[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hello everyone and welcome to Qlips. This is Simplified Speech. And if you don't know what that is,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   let me explain. Simplified Speech is our series, which features clear, natural, and easy to understand
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.840]   English conversations between native speakers about an interesting topic. And I am joined here
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.840]   by my co-host, Indiana today. And we are going to talk about a very interesting topic indeed,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.560]   I think. But first, let's say hello to Indiana. Indiana, hello. How's it going?
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.080]   Hey, Andrew. Hello listeners. I'm doing well. I'm a bit tired from work this week. It's been a long
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.000]   one, but I'm hanging in there. I'm still here. Hanging in there. You know, I was thinking today,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.840]   I was listening to a podcast as I was heading to work myself. And I thought I'm going to give
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.440]   a shout out to all of the Qlips listeners who are commuting to work right now. So if you are listening
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.400]   to this podcast and you are on your way to work, I hope you have a great day and a shout out to
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.800]   all of our commuters. Hey, if you're heading home after the work day too, we'll give a shout out to
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.520]   you as well. Thank you to all of the listeners out there who are spending their free time studying
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.280]   English on their way to work and from work. We really appreciate you guys. Indiana, maybe this
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.080]   is a fitting segue talking about work because, well, I'll let you do the honors. Could you introduce
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.600]   our topic? What are we talking about today? Sure. So today, we're planning on discussing
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.520]   retirement. So basically, you know, I think we'll talk about what some common lifestyles are or
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.200]   activities that people pursue after retirement. And, you know, I live in the United States and
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.800]   you're living in Korea and you're from Canada, right? So we can talk about those different perspectives,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.320]   what we're seeing. Yeah, perhaps what when is a common age to retire? And yeah, what we think
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.480]   would be our dream retirement lifestyle, I suppose. Everything about retirement. And
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.640]   yeah, it's projecting well into the future for me. I'm only 41 and Indiana, I think you're quite a
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.760]   bit younger than I am. So almost 30. Almost 30. Okay, so we got a long way to go before we can
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.640]   retire. But we can talk about it, we can dream about it and think about it. And that's what we
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.560]   will do in this episode. So guys, we'll get started with our conversation in just a moment. But before
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.200]   we do, I want to let everyone know that there is a helpful study guide, plus an interactive transcript,

[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.400]   let's get started with our episode four today, which is all about retirement. And maybe we'll start
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.600]   Indiana by talking about some typical retirement dreams. So maybe we'll start with the USA and
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.320]   your country and your context. What does the typical American think of when they think of
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:41.120]   retiring? What is like the ideal retirement? I think for a lot of people, it's filling their time
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.320]   with their hobbies and not having to worry about work and just focusing on, let's say, playing golf
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.040]   all day or traveling whenever you want to, without worrying about taking time off from work or
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.400]   your kids that you have to take care of. You basically don't have so many responsibilities
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.840]   anymore. So I think a lot of people just want to spend their time having new experiences and
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.960]   enjoying their hobbies and traveling. But also specifically for the United States, I would say,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.720]   and I live in the Northeast, right? So our winters are incredibly cold. I think a lot of people who
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:27.040]   are from New York City or the Northeast might dream of moving to Florida, permanently relocating
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   to a warmer state, like Florida, where there's lots of retirement communities and people of that age.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.280]   Or perhaps even Arizona, I do know that there's been a lot of migration, like within the United
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.760]   States. A lot of people moving from one state to another state. A lot of people are choosing
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.120]   Arizona, like old and young alike. It's a very popular state to be living in right now.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.160]   So yeah, I think those are some of the first things that come to mind for me.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.240]   How about you, Andrew? What do you think? Did I miss anything key here?
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.520]   No, that sounds like you nailed it. I think in Canada, it's a little bit different, but pretty
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.720]   much the same, very similar in that people like to pursue their hobbies once they retire.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.480]   So I think golf, especially for guys, you see, if you go to the golf course early in the morning
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.040]   during a weekday, it's going to be a lot of retirees there hanging out and playing golf,
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.600]   or maybe doing some other kind of sport that's not too physically demanding, right? I don't think
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.920]   there are a ton of retirees that are playing football, like tackle football or anything like that.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.360]   But I know that there are men's leagues for seniors in Canada for ice hockey.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.960]   So yeah, all sorts of different sports and leisure activities, hobby activities.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.240]   Mentioning Florida and Arizona, that's a great one. There are people in Canada who are called
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.080]   snowbirds. That's the nickname that we have for them. And snowbirds are people who go south for
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.720]   the winter to live in the warmer climate of like the southern United States and then come back to
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.080]   Canada for the summer. They spend the winter in the southern part of the United States, Florida,
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.680]   Arizona, like you mentioned, states like that that have a nice warm climate in the winter.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.040]   And then in the summertime, when it's nice in Canada, they'll go back. So we call those people
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:32.720]   snowbirds. And yeah, there are a lot of snowbirds who are retirees. Also travel, I think a lot of
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   people who couldn't travel when they were younger, maybe due to work or family responsibilities,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.680]   once they retire, then that becomes an option for them. However, even I'm feeling it now,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.840]   Indiana, when I'm 40, it's like traveling is a lot of effort. Of course, it's fun. It's really
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.440]   eye opening. It's a great experience. But it is physically demanding. You have to walk a lot. You
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:04.320]   have to spend a long time on cramped airplanes and sometimes stay in hotels that aren't so great.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   It's kind of thing. So it is physically demanding. So there are cruises which are really popular
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:18.160]   with retirees in Canada. I think a cruise is like the way to do it or an all inclusive vacation.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.600]   All inclusive is where everything is provided for you, right? The hotel, all of the food,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.560]   all of the transportation, you don't have to do any planning on your own. Just everything is
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:35.920]   provided for you all inclusive. So I think retired people tend to gravitate towards that kind of
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.360]   vacation. And to gravitate, that's kind of a difficult expression. So I'll explain it. It
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.960]   just means to do that sort of naturally. That feels like the most natural. Gravity is pulling you
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.640]   in that direction, right? You're getting pulled towards the all inclusive vacation just because
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.160]   it's easier and more convenient. You're naturally drawn to it, exactly.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:07.360]   Yeah. Okay, very good. Indiana, you mentioned that Florida and Arizona are kind of places that
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.120]   retirees like to go. And guys, that's what we can call a retired person is a retiree.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.240]   Do you know why retirees like to go to those states? Are there any other reasons?
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:25.680]   You know, part of it could be in the United States, there are different tax laws. Of course,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.520]   there are federal tax laws, but state to state, there are individual tax laws. So some states
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   don't have any income tax, although I guess when you're retired, that's not as much of a problem. But
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.480]   there are various differences between states with their taxes and affordability as well.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.920]   So that could be a part of it. But mainly, I really think it's the weather. You think of Florida
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:57.440]   and you think of beaches. And it's like, just a vacation every day, probably. And then Arizona,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:04.240]   it's a very dry heat. So you're, unless you're really exerting yourself, you're probably not
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.520]   going to sweat very much. Like it actually, the heat can sort of dry, wick away the sweat that
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   gets on you. So it's a very comfortable heat, I think, to live in that environment. So I think,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.560]   yeah, just the weather, the comfortable temperature, that means a lot to a lot of people.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.560]   If you had to choose between Florida or Arizona, those are your only two options. Which one would
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.320]   you choose? That's so tough. I don't want to go to either place. But maybe-- That's not the
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:43.520]   option. I know. Oh, good. I would choose Arizona just because I like that dry heat compared to the
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.600]   humid heat. And there's no gators in Arizona. You don't have to worry about the alligators.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.760]   But there are tarantulas. I've visited my husband's family there once. And when we
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.720]   were walking up to their front door, there was just this massive tarantula, which is like,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.000]   it looks like a spider for listeners who haven't heard this term tarantula. It's like the biggest
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.480]   spider you've ever seen. And it's got thick legs and it's hairy. So they have their own critters in
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.840]   Arizona. But yeah, I think I agree with you. The dry heat is pretty appealing.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:22.160]   OK. Let's move on to our second talking point for this episode. We're going to talk about some
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:30.640]   of the cultural practices around retirements. And maybe this varies from state to state as well.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.720]   I'm not sure. I know many things in America vary from state to state. But in Canada, we have more--
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.480]   Well, things sometimes do vary from province to province as well. Tax is a good example.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.640]   That varies from province to province. But as far as retirements is concerned, the retirement age
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:58.320]   in Canada is 65 years old. So once you hit 65, then you are able to retire and receive your pension
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   and some benefits that are associated with retirements. How about in the States? Is it the same? Do you
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.480]   have like a national retirement age? Or does it vary from place to place? I think the standard age
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:19.200]   now for retirement is about 66. But yeah, as you mentioned, with a public pension or public
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:26.800]   retirement benefits, so we have the Social Security Administration, which administers retirement
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   money. And you can, I believe, choose to retire a little bit earlier. Maybe like, I think it's 62
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:41.680]   years old. But if you choose to receive those benefits earlier, you get less of them, like they
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:48.480]   give you a smaller amount of money per month. And then if you choose to retire later, like at 67 or
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:57.680]   68, I think you can receive more per month. So somebody who's ready or willing to continue working
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:04.080]   past 66, maybe they're going to say to themselves, like, oh, actually, it would be worth it for me
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.200]   to keep working. I like my job. I'm feeling fit and physically well. And then I can get more money
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.400]   later per month. So I think a lot of people take that into consideration when they're going to
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.160]   retire, because they will receive more or less benefits. Yeah, very interesting. So if you retire
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   early, then you get a smaller benefit for a longer amount of time, assuming that you live a long time.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:37.040]   Right. But if you keep working later, then you get more benefit, but for a smaller amount of time.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   Interesting. Indiana, I'm going to ask you a controversial question here. And that is,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:52.720]   do you think workers should be forced to retire at age 65? Because as you were saying, just a second
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.680]   ago, like, it seems like there's an option to keep working. Maybe you could work until you're 70 years
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.840]   old, for example, and you're not forced out by the company or forced out because of a law. Now,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.800]   of course, this might vary from company to company. I'm not sure about each different employers policy
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:19.280]   on this, but should workers be forced to retire at 65? On the one hand, I could see how many people
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.160]   would think like, I'm still physically able to work. And I love my job. And I don't want to retire.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.160]   I want to keep going. That makes a lot of sense to me if that is your situation. On the other hand,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:37.360]   I could see how so many young people would be like, okay, retire, I need this job. Like, we need to
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.080]   clear some space for the new people to come into the company and to enter the economy and start working.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.240]   So yeah, I don't know. It's kind of a tough situation, but what do you think if you had to choose a side?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.440]   That's very tough. If I think about like a flat rule, like everybody has to retire at this age,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:06.160]   it applies to everybody. I don't I don't love it. But I do think that I guess would be fair. I think
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:14.800]   I have an issue more if if it's the rule is applied on a case by case basis, because then that sounds
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:22.560]   more like age discrimination, right? So I and I believe in like workers rights very much. So, you know, if one person
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:30.080]   is 65 and another person 65 and the first person, the boss just likes them and wants them around. And
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   but the other person, they just don't like them. And they can use this age discrimination. You know, I mean,
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:42.320]   this rule, they can use it to kick them out of the company, force them to retire. I don't think that
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:49.040]   would be fair for at all. It seems quite discriminatory, and it could it could be used unfairly. So I
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:56.240]   would feel a little uncomfortable with that, I think. But on the other hand, quickly moving to just a
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.560]   brief digression to politics, so many people in the United States are complaining that the people who
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:10.160]   represent them in in Congress or in the government, like the there's such a skew, the the amount of
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:18.560]   people in their like 70s and 80s who are serving, and then them, it does not represent democratically,
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.280]   necessarily the younger people's thoughts and ideas, though there's a very big generation split
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.800]   there. And there's predominantly, which means just mostly a lot of older people serving in the
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:35.280]   government. So perhaps for something like that, it would be helpful to have a more diverse
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.520]   group of people from different ages to get, like you said, get that new blood, get new people who
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.480]   have different perspectives into the workplace. And in this case, the government, that could be
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.720]   very helpful. So I don't know, I feel a little worried about it, because it sounds a bit discriminatory,
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.880]   but in some cases, it could be quite quite helpful. Okay, now I'm going to force you to answer the
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:08.080]   controversial question. As a tough one, I can see both sides of it. I think if I have to choose
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:14.320]   a side, I'm going to say forced retirement for everyone at 65, just because we need to give young
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:21.360]   people work. I think we need to get young people employed. And I think if you're older, maybe you
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.600]   have some money, you can go do what you want in your retirement. I'm assuming maybe that there's
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:34.320]   a pension like in Canada for people who are attires. Hopefully there is like, hopefully the government
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.800]   is taking care of retirees to an extent, at least I hope that's true. There's always concern that
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.400]   the pension fund is going to run out and there won't be enough money for retirees. But assuming
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:52.880]   yes, that, you know, they're okay, then sure, you guys can go give some space to the young folk,
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.480]   we need to get them in and get them working. And it's I think it's stressful for young people when
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.080]   they can't find employment. So I want to give them an opportunity. At the same time, I realized that
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:11.520]   65 is not actually that old. And those people do have a lot of experience and wisdom. And that's
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.040]   like definitely very, very beneficial. So that's why it's so hard to make this decision. But
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:23.200]   maybe we could find a role for them somewhere else. I'm not sure. Maybe they could be better
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.680]   used in some other capacity. But I don't know, it's a tough one. It's a tough one.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:37.280]   Indiana, what about some of the different options for people when they retire? I've heard of semi
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:43.760]   retirement before. I've also heard of second careers before. Do you know anything about these?
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:53.440]   Well, from my personal life, I see that my father-in-law is completely retired and he spends a lot of
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:59.440]   his time, as we mentioned, like, you know, he'll travel or he actually runs a chapter of a BMW car
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.760]   club. So he's pretty active in his own, in his own way, doing a sort of second job. Of course,
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:14.160]   that's not paid. It's like volunteering. But my mother-in-law is semi-retired. So she was a kind
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.400]   of call, just an OBGYN. She used to deliver babies. Now she's not doing that sort of surgical setting,
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:28.720]   baby delivery activity anymore. But she will teach med students or she'll go into a clinic like once
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   maybe twice a week and see patients and sort of mentor medical students. So that's kind of like her
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:44.240]   semi retirement situation where she still works. But it's very few hours, maybe like 15, 20, maybe
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.680]   even less than that per week. And it's very satisfying for her because, you know, she's still getting
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:56.080]   to participate in the career that she loved, but she has a lot more time to, yeah, enjoy her semi
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.320]   retirement and focus on sports and enjoying time with her husband and everything like that.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.280]   Okay, yeah, that's exactly what I was just thinking about when we were debating that issue a second
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   ago. I think we need forced semi retirement at 65. Okay, not full retirement. But yeah,
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.240]   come into the office like a day or two a week, mentor the new employees, you know,
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.320]   that kind of thing, that sounds good to me. Maybe that's like an ideal compromise.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.200]   Right, when you have a wealth of experience, yeah, it's kind of a waste to, if you want to
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.120]   participate and contribute and give it back, it's a waste to force somebody out of that.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:44.000]   Yeah, okay, very interesting. And a second career, I know this is really common in Korea. So maybe
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.240]   I could mention it here. And I think it does happen to an extent in North America, but maybe
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.440]   it's more common here in Korea and listeners, I'd love to know if this is a thing in your country
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:03.120]   as well. But many people, once they retire here in Korea, they still need some income,
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:10.880]   they need an income source. And so it's not too uncommon to see senior citizens getting another
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.760]   job, maybe like a part time job as a retired person. So they'll stop working for their company,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   their career, that's finished, and then they'll find something new. And yeah, one of the ones
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:31.280]   that I see I think most often is around apartment complexes. So each apartment complex. And of course,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.880]   the majority of Koreans live in an apartment in there in these big complexes with several
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.560]   towers and thousands of families that live in one complex. So they'll have a security guard.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.520]   And I think because Korea is such a safe country, this is really actually nice.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.800]   Because it's like a safe country, the security guards are often retired men. And I don't think
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.520]   the job really requires them to be like chasing away criminals or anything like this. Like,
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.560]   you know, occasionally there'll be some issue that they have to solve. I was walking my dog the
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.360]   other day in front of an apartment complex. And there was a little fender bender. And so the
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.720]   security guy was out there sort of dealing with that situation. You know, there's like little
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.960]   issues that you have to do maybe maintenance stuff. But yeah, I don't think you're like chasing away
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.560]   criminals or car thieves or anything like that. So it's that's a pretty safe job. And I don't think
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.880]   it's super super physically demanding. And so I know that a lot of retired Korean men
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.280]   think that's a great job for them. And they'll do that as their second second career or as their
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   part time job once they retire. Yeah, that I mean, that sounds nice to like you get to know everybody
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.000]   in your building. If you're social, you say, Hey, how's it going? You know, like, you can sort of
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.720]   really get a sense of that community in the building, which is pretty cool. Yeah. So Indiana, why don't
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:01.360]   we pull out our crystal balls here and we'll we'll look into our futures. And I don't know if it's
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.400]   possible to imagine your retired life right now, like, who knows what the world will look like
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:13.120]   after 20, 30 years for us. But maybe we could talk about just like, our ideal, like, is there
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.960]   anything that you would like to do when when you retire that maybe you maybe you would like to do
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.920]   it now, but you just don't have time because of life. So you're thinking, okay, I'll put that on the
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.800]   back burner and I'll do it later once I retire. I would love to just focus on language learning
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.400]   and like reading and sort of like intellectual pursuits if I had all the time and the day. But
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   also, I think it's really important for me. Like my goal currently right now, looking ahead for the
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.160]   future, but also just enjoying life now is like, I'd like to stay fit and physically well and like,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:57.280]   very mobile. I like to try to maintain my level of fitness because, you know, in the hope to enjoy
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:03.840]   life now, but also in the hopes of when I'm actually able to retire, I can do sports any day of the
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.960]   week where I can travel easily without like, you know, experiencing hip pain or like difficulty
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:15.040]   walking. Like, I think that would be a really important part of my retirement would be being
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:21.360]   able to be physically fit and travel easily and, you know, not be limited if I can help it from
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   enjoying what I want to enjoy. So I think just the typical things for me, you know, traveling,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:34.000]   enjoying some casual sports and socializing. But one thing I can think of that would be,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.760]   I'd like to do it sooner than retirement, but also retirement would be a great age to do this,
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:46.800]   would be like host an exchange student from a high school or from a university. Because when I went
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:54.880]   to Japan, I stayed with a host family and I was, you know, a middle-aged mom and husband and two
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.920]   kids, right? So they weren't retired. But it was such an amazing experience. And I thought it was
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:05.040]   so cool what they offered me and like, how they let me into their lives. And I would love to do
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:10.960]   that someday. So yeah, when I have all the time during the day to think about what I can cook for
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:17.760]   my guests or like where we can go on the weekends, that would be a cool American cultural experience
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.600]   for them. I feel like that would be an awesome way to spend my retirement. So yeah, that's one of my
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.440]   dreams, I guess, if you, for my golden years, as they say, so that beautiful, relaxed, wonderful
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:35.200]   time of your life, your golden years. Nice. Yeah, that's interesting. I have a cousin, an older
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:41.760]   cousin that's, I don't know exactly how old she is, but probably at least 20, 25 years older than me.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   So she's right around retirement age. And in fact, I think she might be retired. And her and her
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:54.240]   husband do that. They host students that I think mostly host Chinese students, but maybe some Japanese
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:01.280]   in Korean as well. I think those students hit the jackpot. Like she she loves them. She's always
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.440]   talking about them whenever I see her. She's always talking about her students, almost like they're
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.880]   her children. Like she really takes such good care of them. And so yeah, I think that could be,
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:16.240]   could be really fun. So that's a great idea. I also liked how you mentioned the intellectual
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.160]   pursuits, because this is something that I've always wanted to do in my life. And I would love
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.720]   to do it now. I just really can't dedicate the time, but that's to a PhD degree. So I think
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:36.240]   once I retire, and I suddenly have some time, like, why not just go back to university and do a PhD and
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   just enjoy the study, maybe, maybe with like no pressure of graduating. Like, I don't know if the
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.520]   university would love that or not, but like, take my time, you know, just take one class a semester
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:55.760]   and study and learn and keep my brain active. And as far as I know, in Canada, university education
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:01.440]   is free for retirees. They can go and attend university for free. So wouldn't even have to pay
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.720]   tuition. Yeah. So I always thought, Hey, why not? Well, you know, I'd love to do a PhD now, but I just
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.200]   can't take five years out of my life to put my life on hold while I go back to study. Of course.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.800]   Well, what would you like to study in your dream retirement and going back and doing your PhD?
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   Yeah. Well, I mean, I did my masters in applied linguistics and my life's work here is related
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:32.000]   to that topic, right? Teaching English and studying Korean and thinking about second language acquisition.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.920]   So probably it would be related to that. But yeah, who knows what second language acquisition will
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:43.600]   look like after 20 years, I might need to find a different thing to study a different focus.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:49.280]   Or who knows, maybe I would just start from scratch and do a whole new field that I have
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.840]   no experience in that could be cool too. Maybe I'll do both. I don't know. But I've always
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:00.960]   thought that maybe I'll spend my retirement studying and trying to become Dr. Andrew. We'll see that
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.040]   that might be something I'd like to do. And I also dream about maybe going back to Canada in my
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:14.160]   retirement as well. And I guess I wouldn't necessarily be a snowbird because the winter in Korea is
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:20.160]   not so cold. I guess I'd be the opposite. I would like to spend the winter in Korea and spend the
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:26.800]   summer in Canada just because the summer in Korea is so nasty and hot and humid. So I go back to
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.000]   Canada for the nice pleasant summer and then come back to Korea for the fall and the winter. Maybe
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.760]   that's the plan. I love it. And it's such a beautiful dream. Even if when you retire applied
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:46.320]   linguistics, PhD, it's not relevant in the same way that it is today. Who cares? You're not expecting
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.080]   to get a job after your PhD in your retirement. You're just studying for the sake of enjoying the
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.360]   learning and advancing your mind. So like, yeah, study whatever you want. That's like the perfect
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:05.600]   dream. It sounds so nice. No stress about the job, just pure knowledge. Right. Yeah. And maybe even
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.560]   you could contribute to the field, right? Like adding to the body of knowledge, doing some research
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.880]   and adding that way. Yeah, I think that'd be fun. So I've always thought that that could be the move
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:24.000]   for when I retire. Very cool. Okay, Indiana, I think we're almost at the end of this episode. But
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.760]   before we wrap up, we were planning to share some retirement related expressions with everyone here.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:38.320]   So guys, we prepared some there aren't actually too many expressions about retirement. At least
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:43.920]   not too many positive ones. There are like a lot of English expressions for when you're older and
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.560]   maybe getting towards the end of your life. And maybe we could do a different episode about that.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:56.960]   It's a little darker, but we do have some kind of positive idioms and expressions about retirement.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.920]   So let's share them with everyone, Indiana. I'll let you go first. Which one would you like to
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:10.720]   introduce? Sure. So I mentioned a little earlier, I said my golden years. So that refers to your
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:17.440]   retirement age or the later stage in your life, perhaps your 60s, 70s, even your 80s.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:26.640]   People who are interested in US TV shows or media, you may have heard of or should look up the golden
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:33.680]   girls. It's like a funny sitcom from a few decades ago with Betty White. And it was like sort of
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.440]   this comedy show about these retired women. And I imagine they probably also live in Florida. I
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:46.080]   don't remember for sure. But it seems like they're in a very warm climate. Yeah. So the golden years
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.360]   is just a very nice, you know, that that word coming from gold. And it's like, ah, this beautiful
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.760]   time, this rich time when you're, you don't have to work and you're enjoying your life. That's your
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:02.160]   your golden years, your retirement years. And we should also mention the David Bowie song,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.320]   Indiana. And I were mentioning before we started recording that we can't say this expression,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:14.400]   golden years without getting the David Bowie song stuck in our heads. So guys, if you don't know
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.960]   the David Bowie song called golden years, you're going to have to go to your music app and search
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.600]   for it. And just be warned, it will be stuck in your head for a long time. It's a very catchy tune.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.840]   It's quite an earworm. Yeah, but it's good. It's worth it. Look it up, guys.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:36.880]   A kind of related expression, which is a little darker is called your twilight years. And twilight
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:42.160]   is the time of day. Just when the sun is setting, it's like around sunset, you know, maybe sun has
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:48.480]   just sets and it's not quite dark yet. It's actually a really nice time of the day, especially in the
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.640]   summer. But that time of the day is called twilight. And yeah, you could imagine your twilight years,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:00.400]   there's some imagery there, right? The sun is setting, it's getting darker, you're getting towards
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.720]   the end of your life. So golden years is more positive. Twilight years is kind of like when
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:12.880]   you're getting towards the end. So those two expressions, Indiana, I thought of one. And I was
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.200]   going to share it with you before we started recording. And then it totally escaped my minds.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.120]   And I couldn't remember. And it was driving me crazy. But during our conversation here,
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:30.880]   it came back to me. And it is an empty nester. So an empty nester is a parent who has no children
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.760]   living with them in the family home anymore. So if you're an empty nester, it means that your
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.120]   kids are all grown up and they've left the home and they have their own life that they are living
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:48.720]   now. And so I think a lot of retirees are empty nesters. So yeah, absolutely. It's an expression
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:54.560]   we use a lot in that context. It's funny that there's that word, because it's coming from this
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.640]   idea of a bird who has a nest that they live in. And then they had eggs, but now their baby birds
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.600]   have left. There's no, there's no babies left. There's no eggs. There's empty nester. And then
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:14.480]   there's also this could be related to retirement, this expression nest egg. So a nest egg is basically,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:21.120]   usually it's money, but I guess it could be an asset like a house. But usually a nest egg is a
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:27.680]   large amount of savings that you have put away for the future, expecting your retirement. I guess
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:34.080]   it could also be for if you relocated and had a very expensive move or change in your career,
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.800]   or I guess if you had some emergency. But I think for a nest egg, we usually think about these
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:48.000]   savings, this money you keep as for your retirement for the future. So yeah, you might refer to your
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.480]   savings for the future as your nest egg. It's something you're going to enjoy and use later on.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.640]   And it's important to have a nest egg, I would say, if you can.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:06.000]   And then another one that comes to mind is living the good life, to live the good life. And often,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.440]   we say that retired people are living the good life. It just means that, you know, like times are
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.680]   good. You don't have to worry about work or going to the office or hopefully any stress and you can
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.800]   just enjoy those years. You worked hard during your life, you worked hard during your career,
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:28.880]   and now you can enjoy the benefit of that. And we call that living the good life. Although,
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:35.040]   we should clarify that we could use this for any period in our life, but it is just one that is
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:42.080]   often used to talk about retirees. Yeah, I might also use it if I was on a long vacation and it's
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.480]   just been so great. Like, yeah, how are you doing on your vacation? Oh, I'm living the good life.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.320]   I used it like in that context, just the other day, I had a friend who sent me some pictures and he
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.280]   was camping with his family. He's got a little child and he was playing with his boy. And I said,
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   oh, you're living the good life. Like, it looks like you're really happy and enjoying life. So,
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   yeah, we can use it for all kinds of like happy situations, positive situations. But it is one
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:14.960]   that we do use to talk about retirement as well. If the retirement is that kind of happy positive
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:21.440]   situation? For sure. Good. Well, Indiana, I think this will bring us to the end of this episode.
