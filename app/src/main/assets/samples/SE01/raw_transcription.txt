[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   Hey, I'm Andrew, and this is the Qloops English Podcast. Happy New Year!
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.560]   We're kicking off this year by launching a brand new pronunciation series called "Speak Easy" and
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:22.880]   this is the first episode. In this series, Suzanne and I will teach you a ton of tips and tricks to make your pronunciation sound clear,
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.480]   natural, and easily
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.360]   understandable.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.640]   Now the "Speak Easy" study guides are going to look a little different from our regular study guides.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.280]   Instead of vocabulary
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.600]   explanations and examples,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.320]   "Speak Easy" study guides come with exercises that let you
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.120]   practice the pronunciation tips and tricks that you'll learn. And of course, the transcript is still
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.040]   included as it always is.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:00.040]   So if you want to get the study guide for this episode or any of our other episodes, visit our website
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.040]   qlips.com, C-U-L-I-P-S.com.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.120]   Okay, we're excited about this series. I think you'll like it a lot. Let's get right to it.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.680]   Hey everybody, my name is Andrew.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.400]   And I'm Suzanne.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280]   And you're listening to Q-Lips.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:34.440]   Hey, Suzanne. Hey Andrew, how are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.600]   Suzanne, I'm super excited because we are
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   debuting a new type of series here on Q-Lips, a
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.080]   non-seation series that we're calling "Speak Easy."
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.320]   Yeah, that's right, Andrew. Our other series, like
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.960]   "Catchword," "Chatterbox," "Real Talk," "Simplified Speech," all of these
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.160]   are designed to help you sound like a native speaker
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.560]   when you talk, so that you use the same
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.480]   vocabulary, the same expressions as a native speech.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.240]   But I think a lot of you guys are interested in actually
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.880]   sounding like a native speaker with your pronunciation.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.680]   And so this is why we decided to do this series, is to help you sound natural
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.880]   with your pronunciation. And Sue is actually a pronunciation teacher and
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.320]   pronunciation coach in her other work, apart from Q-Lips.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.680]   So we have an expert on the Q-Lips team already, so yeah,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.640]   we're very excited to present to you guys with this new series.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.800]   Yeah, and this will offer you some tips and tricks that you can
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.560]   quickly apply to your everyday pronunciation of English.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.680]   And we don't need to sound like a native speaker to be understood,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.080]   but some of these little tips and tricks will help you feel more confident,
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.120]   might help you understand a native speaker speech better,
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.760]   and will help you feel and sound more fluent.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:40.600]   That is right. So today we have a cool little tip and trick to teach you guys.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:51.720]   And we could call this Y insertion or W insertion. When we link together,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.680]   we connect some words together and we insert a Y sound or a W sound
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.560]   to help make a smooth connection between words.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:13.960]   Yeah, when you hear sometimes native English speakers speak, you might not be able to distinguish
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.600]   the words or separate the words that they're saying, because they sound like they're flowing
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.960]   together or connecting really quickly, almost like they're one word. And that's because they
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:36.920]   utilize this little trick and it's a Y or W insertion. Oh, that's so cool. So Suzanne,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:45.400]   maybe you could explain about this pronunciation tip in a little more detail. What is it exactly,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.960]   Y or W insertion? Sure. So in English, whenever a word doesn't end in a consonant,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.480]   like a B or a D, like bad, that ends with a consonant, right?
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:09.640]   D is a consonant. Right. That means it usually will end in a vowel sound. And most of the time in
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:21.720]   English, our words end in the vowel E or O. And that is just how the ends of English words work.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   We tend to just use E and O. So if you have a word that ends in E or O, such as B or U,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:46.680]   and then the next word begins with another vowel, like able or R, you add a Y or W sound between
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.680]   those two words. And if the word ends with an E sound, you'll add an extra Y sound or E,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:04.280]   Y sound before the next word. And if the word ends with an U sound, you'll add an extra
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:12.920]   W sound or W sound before the next word. That explains it really well. Those are some great
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.960]   rules to follow. But it's a little bit complicated, Suzanne. So let's break it down a little bit
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:30.440]   further. Let's look first at inserting a Y, okay? Inserting a Y at the end of a word that ends with
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:40.920]   E to connect it to another word that starts with a vowel. Yeah. So like, for example, you have the
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:51.720]   phrase, be able, like, right? So I won't be able to make it to the party, be able, I won't be able
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.200]   to make it to the party. Now, of course, there's not very many native speakers that pronounce it,
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:07.080]   like I just did, I won't be able to make it to the party. No, that's not how natural conversation
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:14.440]   works. So when we speed it up to a natural speed, sounds more like, I won't be able to make it to
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:23.480]   the party. I won't be able. Yes. And so it can be difficult sometimes for non native speakers to
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:32.200]   blend those two words, right? Sometimes they'll make it a glottal attack, like be able, be able,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.920]   like there's a kind of a little shock in them in down in the vocal cords area or the throat.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:46.760]   Like they're stopping the air from flowing out of their mouth when they're speaking to try and
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:55.320]   make a separation between be able. Exactly. But that's not how we do it, is it?
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:04.840]   No. And also sometimes some speakers will add like an H sound. So they might say,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:12.760]   be able, be able. And that can make it sound like a different phrase altogether.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.160]   French speakers, we're looking at you right now. Yeah, a lot of times,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:28.520]   because there is there there is no H sound in the French language. Well, there is an H letter,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:36.840]   but they don't pronounce it. So there is no H sound in the French language. So they kind of slip
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:43.240]   it in in English in a lot of different places to make up for it. And this, in this case, there is
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:51.800]   a tendency to do that between two vowels. So since the B, if you think about it, the B ends in an E
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:09:01.320]   sound and the able begins with a vowel sound, try putting Andrew a Y or a E sound between the two
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:10.200]   words in order to blend them. Okay, so I start with B, B, and then I switch to able. So B,
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:18.760]   able. And then I can connect it by saying, be able, be able. Yeah, be able. Is that right?
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:26.040]   That's right. That's right. And you guys can try along with us. Be able, be able.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:36.200]   Be able, be able. And you can really feel your mouth, right? If you pay attention to the shape of
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.680]   your mouth, it's really going to pull back. Your lips are pulling back towards your ears.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:48.760]   Like a smile. Like a smile when you're making that Y sound, like be able.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:57.720]   Yeah. And your tongue is usually in this kind of sound, the E sound, the tip of your tongue is
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:05.160]   behind your lower front teeth. And the front and sort of middle part of your tongue is really
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:14.120]   arched forward, right? E, able, be able, right? That's right. So you're kind of extending that
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.920]   E sound is what you're doing. You're kind of going a little more intense just so that it is long
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:29.080]   enough to connect to the next word. Suzanne, what are a couple of other words that use this
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:36.120]   pronunciation technique or some other phrases that we can hear this pronunciation technique used in?
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:46.600]   There are some common ones, right? Like she is. She is. Oh, yeah. She is. So it's not she is.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:53.800]   It's she is. She is. She is. Yeah. Is she coming to the party? Yeah, she is.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.480]   Yeah, she is. She is. Right. Or he is, right? He is.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:10.840]   Right. He is. He is. Yeah. Or even they are. They are. They are.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.360]   Are they coming to the party? Yes, they are. Yes, they are.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:24.760]   Yeah. And it's subtle. We're kind of emphasizing it a little bit more, doing it a little bit
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:34.280]   more extreme than in rapid speech. So when you do it in rapid speech, it's maybe not as strong
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:41.320]   as we're doing it right now for as an example. That's a good point. We are over emphasizing it,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:48.520]   but guys, at the ends of this episode, we're going to present you with a dialogue conversation
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:57.480]   example, where you'll hear many words and phrases using the pronunciation tips and techniques that
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.400]   we're teaching you today. And we will do that at a completely normal conversational speed.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:11.560]   You'll be able to hear all of these examples of connected speech spoken at a totally normal
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:17.960]   conversational pace in the dialogue at the end. So while we're explaining it here, we're kind of
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.120]   over emphasizing so you can hear it. And then you'll be able to practice listening at regular
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:33.240]   speed at the end. Yeah. And just to cap it off with the why insertion, you also can put a why
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:44.760]   in the middle of a word. For example, create, create, or creative, or regular, regular.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:53.400]   Oh, I hear that. So create, create, create, you can hear the why in the middle. And
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:13:04.280]   Sue, is that because you have the same instance of an e sound being beside a vowel in a multi-syllable
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:12.520]   word? Yeah. So if you think about it, Cree is an e sound, right? That's a pure vowel e. And then
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:19.480]   the next syllable is actually made up of a diphthong, right? Which is when you have two vowel sounds
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.800]   that come together to make one. So technically you have like three vowel sounds going on there.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:33.800]   Cree eight, Cree eight. And in order to blend them all together, you sort of extend that e sound
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:45.480]   so that it doesn't sound too choppy. Create, create. Yeah, this is, I guess, an example of English
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.720]   speakers just being a little lazy, right? Yeah. We were just trying to find a shortcut like
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:58.680]   linking all these vowels together is just too much effort. So how can we make it
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:07.800]   flow? How can we make it be smooth? And adding the why is how we do that. So again, we'll take a
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:16.280]   word like Cree eight and then smush it together, make it smooth by adding the why and changing it
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:26.600]   to create. Exactly. Now we also have the similar, a similar effect with the W insertion or the
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:35.240]   sound, right? When we're representing it with a letter, we can use the W letter, but it's really
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:43.800]   the w sound, right? Or the ooh, right? We are extending the ooh sound. Okay, so could you break
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:53.480]   this down for us? So in what environment do we want to insert this ooh or w sound? So it's very
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:05.880]   similar to the why insertion rule. If you have the end of a word ending in ooh and then the next word
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:15.480]   beginning with a vowel sound, you want to add a little bit more ooh or a W sound in order to link
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:24.840]   them and make it more connected. For example, the phrase you asked her, you asked her, right?
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:30.680]   So some people could want to maybe do the glottal attack again and say you asked, you asked her,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:38.600]   you asked her, you asked her, right? And kind of attack on the a it's too much effort though to do
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:46.040]   that. It's easier just to add that w in there and say you asked her, you asked her, you asked her.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:56.360]   You asked her. Did I ask her? No, you asked her. You asked her, yeah. Good. Okay, so we have you
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:05.080]   asked her. What's another example? Yeah, so we also have you are, you are, you are. You are,
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:17.960]   you are. Yeah, you are. How is it? How is it? How is it? How is it? How is it? Yeah, like I just
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:25.320]   moved to Montreal. Oh, yeah. How is it? How is it there? Right. How is it there? And you could,
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:32.760]   maybe if you're having a dinner party and yeah, sit down to try the food that you just cooked for
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:40.440]   them, you could ask them. How is it? How is it? Yeah, and hopefully they say it's delicious.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:46.440]   It's to die for. You can also put it in the middle of words similar to the Y insertion.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:56.760]   You can say cow word. Cow word. Cow word. Yeah. Yeah, so there's extra cow,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:06.440]   erd, right? Cow, erd, but cow word. So you kind of bring that W over to the R sound word.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:17.000]   Let's see. And then nowhere. Nowhere. Nowhere. Nowhere. Nowhere. Yeah.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:32.200]   Or however, however, yeah, how we don't say how ever it's however. Yeah. However, blah, blah,
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:41.880]   so Suzanne, I think it's time that we play that conversation example for all of our listeners so
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   that they can hear many instances of these two techniques in a conversation that occurs at a
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.960]   totally normal conversational pace. Yeah. So let's take a listen to that right now.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:09.080]   Hey, didn't you have that interview today? I don't think I'll be able to go. I heard they
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:16.520]   don't pay overtime. Well, nowhere pays overtime these days. True, but I hear there's going to be
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:24.040]   some new openings over at Google. Wow, a job there would be so awesome. Are you sure they're hiring?
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:31.560]   Yeah, I heard they are. It's a regular desk job. Yeah, it's a regular desk job. However,
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:45.960]   the hours are flexible. All right. So in that dialogue example, did you hear any Y or W
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:54.920]   insertions in words or phrases? Let's see if we can pick them out. Andrew. Yeah, I heard an example
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:03.080]   when the lady said, "I don't think I'll be able to go. Be able to go. Be able. Be able."
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:12.200]   Yeah, exactly. Be able. There was a Y insertion there. And actually, in the word interview, too,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:22.600]   "view." Oh, yeah. In the word "view," right before, we don't say "vue," right? We add a little bit of a Y
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:32.200]   before. It's "vue." That's right. Hey, didn't you have that interview? You interview today.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:43.640]   Yeah, exactly. The lady in the conversation was complaining about that company not paying overtime.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:51.000]   Yes. They don't pay overtime. Pay overtime. So there we can hear that Y sound again, right?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:01.160]   Don't pay overtime. Exactly. And then the gentleman said, "Well, nowhere, nowhere pays overtime these
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:10.440]   days. Nowhere." So there was an extra W. Extra W sound. Very good. Yeah. And then, well, the lady
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:17.800]   responded by saying, "Well, there's going to be some new openings over at Google. New openings,
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:27.320]   new openings." So we see the word "new" and openings connected together by the insertion of that W sound.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:36.360]   New openings. Yeah. And then, we also have a simple one, which we say quite a lot, right?
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:46.200]   So awesome. Wow. A job there would be so awesome. So awesome. So awesome. Oh, my God. It would be so
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:56.440]   awesome. Yeah. So again, they're linked so and awesome. Are linked together by the W insertion.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   Yeah. And then we also have regular. We don't say regular. It's regular. Regular desk job. Regular
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:17.320]   desk job. It's a regular desk job. Exactly. Yeah. And then, I think the last one we have, we say, yeah,
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:29.160]   it's a regular desk job. However, however the hours are flexible. However. So there we added a W.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:38.600]   Right. Another example of the W insertion. However, to connect that all together and make it smooth
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:55.880]   and polished sounding. Well, Sue, I think that is all the time that we have for today.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:05.880]   Yeah. Well, today we learn two simple tricks that help our speech flow. We learn the Y and the W
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:13.400]   insertion. So whenever you're in a bind, you can remember to put a Y sound when the word ends with
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:21.480]   an E and the next word starts with a vowel. And you can add a W sound when one word ends in U
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:31.080]   and the next word starts with a vowel. That is right. Our website is qlips.com. And we are on
