[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   The New York Times, April 22nd 1910, Front Page, Mark Twain is dead at 74.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.040]   Read for LibraVox.org by Esther.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.360]   And comes peacefully at his New England home after a long illness.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.160]   Conscious a little before, Carlisle's French Revolution lay beside him.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.400]   Give me my glasses, his last words.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.760]   Surviving child with him.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.800]   Tragic death of his daughter Jean recently did much to hurry his end.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.340]   Danbury, Connecticut, April 21, Samuel, Longhorn, Clemens.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.080]   Mark Twain died 22 minutes after 6 tonight.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.560]   Beside him on the bed lay a beloved book.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.000]   It was Carlisle's French Revolution.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.680]   And near the book his glasses pushed away with a weary sigh a few hours before.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.160]   Too weak to speak clearly, give me my glasses.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.640]   He had written on a piece of paper.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.800]   He had received them, put them down, and sunk into unconsciousness from which he glided
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.360]   almost imperceptibly into death.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.960]   He was in his seventy-fifth year.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.320]   For some time his daughter Clara and her husband, Asip Cabrioitz, and the humerous biographer
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   Albert Biglo Payne, had been by the bed waiting for the end, which Dr. Quintard and Halsey
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320]   had seen to be a matter of minutes.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.080]   The patient felt absolutely no pain at the end, and the moment of his death was scarcely
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.720]   noticeable.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.240]   Death came, however, while his favorite niece, Mrs. E. E. Lumes, and her husband, who was
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.720]   vice president of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Am, western railway, and a nephew, Gervis
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.280]   Langdon, were on the way to the railroad station.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.520]   They had left the house much encouraged by the fact that the sick man had recognized
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.920]   them, and took a train for New York ignorant of what happened later.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.360]   Hopes aroused yesterday.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.560]   Although the end had been foreseen by the doctors and would not have been a shock at
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.000]   any time, the apparently strong rally of this morning had given basis for the hope that
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   it would be postponed for several days.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.600]   After Clemens awoke at about four o'clock this morning, after a few hours of the first
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.680]   natural sleep he had had for several days, and the nurses could see, by the brightness
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.280]   of his eyes, that his vitality had been considerably restored.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.560]   He was able to raise his arms above his head and clasped them behind his neck with the
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.200]   first evidence of physical comfort he had given for a long time.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.400]   His strength seemed to increase, enough to allow him to enjoy the sunrise, the first signs
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.560]   of which he could see out of the windows in the three sides of the room where he lay.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.480]   The increasing sunlight seemed to bring ease to him, and by the time the family was about,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.520]   he was strong enough to sit up in bed, and overjoyed them by recognizing all of them
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.040]   and speaking a few words to each.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.260]   This was the first time that his mental powers had been fully his for nearly two days, with
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.800]   the exception of a few minutes early last evening, when he addressed a few sentences
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   to his daughter.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.040]   Examples for his book For two hours he lay in bed enjoying the feeling of this return
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.800]   of strength, then he made of movement, asked in a faint voice for a copy of Carlisle's
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.560]   French Revolution, which he has always had near him for the last year, and which he has
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.040]   read and reread and brooded over.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.320]   The book was handed to him, and he lifted it up as if to read.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.000]   Then a smile faintly eliminated his face when he realized that he was trying to read without
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.760]   his glasses.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.480]   He tried to say, "Give me my glasses," but his voice failed, and the nurses bending
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.640]   over him could not understand.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.880]   He motioned for a sheet of paper and a pencil, and wrote what he could not say.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.840]   With his glasses on he read a little, and then slowly put the book down with a sigh.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.600]   Soon he appeared to become drowsy and settled on his pillow.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.520]   Gradually he sank and settled into lethargy.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.920]   Doctor Halsey appreciated that he could have been roused, but considered it better for him
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.400]   to rest.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.040]   At three o'clock he went into complete unconsciousness.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.400]   Later Dr. Quintard, who had arrived from New York, held a consultation with Dr. Halsey,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   and it was decided that death was near.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.440]   The family was called and gathered about the bedside, watching in a silence which was long
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.080]   and broken.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.280]   It was the end, at twenty-two minutes past six, with the sunlight just turning red as
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.320]   it stole into the window in perfect silence he breathed his last.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.640]   Died of a broken heart.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.680]   The people of Reading, Bethel, and Danbury listened when they were told that the doctor
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.480]   said Mark Twain was dying of angina pectoris, but they say among themselves that he died
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.440]   of a broken heart.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.040]   When this is a verdict, not of popular sentiment alone, Albert Bijlo Payne, his biographer
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.760]   to be, and literary executor, who has been constantly with him, said that for the last
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.800]   year, at least, Mr. Clemens had been weary of life.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.200]   When Richard Watson Gilder died he said, "How fortunate he is.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.080]   No good fortune of that kind ever comes to me."
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.720]   The man who has stood to the public for the greatest humerus this country has produced
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.440]   has, in private life, suffered overwhelming sorrows.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.500]   The loss of an only son in infancy, a daughter in her teens, and one in middle life.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.800]   And finally, of a wife who was a constant and sympathetic companion, has prayed upon
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.320]   his mind.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.600]   The recent loss of his daughter Jean, who was closest to him in later years, when her
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.720]   sister was abroad studying, was the final blow.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.680]   On the heels of this came the first symptoms of the disease which was surely to be fatal,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.600]   and one of whose accompaniments is mental depression.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.880]   Mr. Payne says that all heart went out of him, and his work when his daughter Jean died.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.200]   He has practically written nothing since he summoned his energies to write a last chapter
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.520]   memorial of her for his autobiography.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.240]   He told his biographer that the past winter in Bermuda was gay, but not happy.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.200]   Bermuda is always gay in winter, and Mark Twain was a central figure in the gayety.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.960]   He was staying at the home of William H. Allen.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.040]   Even in Bermuda, however, Mr. Clemons found himself unable to write, and finally relied
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.320]   on Mr. Allen's fifteen-year-old daughter Helen to write the few letters he cared to send.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.120]   His health failed rapidly, and finally Mr. Allen wrote to Albert Biglow Payne that his
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.280]   friend was in a most serious condition.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.800]   Mr. Payne immediately cabled to Mrs. Braboloitz, his surviving daughter, who was in Europe
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.240]   and started himself on April 2nd for Bermuda, and barking with the humerist for the return
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.080]   to New York immediately after his arrival.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.320]   On the trip over, Mark Twain became very much worse, and finally realized his condition.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.440]   "It's a losing game," he said to his companion, "I'll never get home alive."
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.720]   Mr. Clemons did manage to summon his strength, however, and in spite of being so weak that
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.120]   he had to be carried down the gangplank, he survived the journey to his beautiful place
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.960]   at Reading.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.080]   The first symptom of angina pectoris came last June when he went to Baltimore to address
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.200]   a young lady's school.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.320]   In his room at the hotel he was suddenly taken with a terrible gripping at the heart.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:57.200]   It soon passed away, however, and he was able to make an address with no inconvenience.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.520]   The pains, however, soon returned with more frequency and steadily grew worse until they
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.240]   became a constant torture.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.800]   One of the last acts of Mark Twain was to write out a check for $6,000 for the library
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.560]   in which the literary courtery, settled near Reading, have been interested for a year--fares,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.960]   musical, and sociables having been held in order to raise the necessary amount.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.320]   The library is to be a memorial to Jean Clemons, and will be built on a site about half a mile
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.360]   from Stormfield at Crossroads.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.240]   It is certain to be recalled that Mark Twain was, for more than fifty years, an inveterate
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.240]   smoker, and the first conjecture of the layman would be that he had weakened his heart by
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.120]   overindulgence in tobacco.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.840]   Dr. Housley said tonight that he was unable to say that the angina pectoris from which
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.360]   Mark Twain died wasn't anyway related to nicotine poisoning.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.320]   Some constitutions, he said, seem immune from the effects of tobacco, and his was one of
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   them.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.320]   Yet, it is true that since his illness began, the doctors had cut down Mark Twain's daily
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   allowance of twenty cigars and countless pipes to four cigars a day.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.560]   No deprivation was a greater sorrow to him; he tried to smoke on the steamer while returning
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.520]   from Bermuda, and only gave it up because he was too feeble to draw on his pipe.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.200]   Even on his deathbed, when past the point of speech, and it was no longer certain that
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.320]   his ideas were held, he would make the motion of waving a cigar, and smiling, expel empty
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.360]   air from under the moustache still stained with smoke.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.920]   Where Mark Twain chose to spend his declining years was the first outpost of Methodism in
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.580]   New England, and it was among the hills of Reading that General Israel Putnam, of revolutionary
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.760]   fame, mustered his sparse ranks.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.160]   Putnam Park now encloses the memory of his camp.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.440]   Mark Twain first heard of it, at the dipper given him, on his seventeenth birthday, when
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.240]   a fellow guest, who lived there, mentioned its beauties, and added that there was a vacant
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.840]   house adjoining his own.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.360]   "I think you may buy that old house for me," said Mark Twain.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.680]   Whereward Place was the name of that old house, and where it stood, Mark Twain reared
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:24.120]   the white walls of the Italian villa he first named Innocence at home.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.560]   But a first experience of what a New England Winter storm can be, in its whitest fury,
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:36.480]   quickly caused him to christen it anew, storm-filled, where Mark Twain died.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.920]   The house had been thus described by Albert Bigzilla Payne.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.760]   Set on a fair hillside with such a green slope below, such a view outspread across the valley
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.400]   as made one catch his breath, a little when he first turned to look at it.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.800]   A trout stream flows through one of the meadows.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.280]   There are apple trees and gray stone walls.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.320]   The entrance to it is a winding lane.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.440]   Through this lane the innocent at home loved to wander in his white flannels, for homely
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.520]   gossip with the neighbours.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.680]   They remember him best as one who above all things loved a good listening.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.800]   For Mark Twain was a mighty talker, stored with fairy tales, for little maids he adored,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.480]   and ruder speech for more masculine ears.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.880]   It is a legend that he was vastly proud of his famous mop of white hair, and used to spend
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:35.560]   the pains of a court lady in getting it to just the proper stage of artistic disarray.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:41.000]   The burial will be in the family plot at Elmira, New York, where lie already his wife, his
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.240]   two daughters, Susan and Jean, and his infant son, Langhorn.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.120]   No date has yet been sent, as the family is still undecided whether or not there should
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.120]   be a public funeral first in New York City.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.840]   It is probable that Stormfield will be kept as a summer place by Mrs. Gabrielowitz, who
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.200]   is very fond both of the house and the country, although her husband's musical engagements
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.840]   make it necessary that she spend a part of each year abroad.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.040]   Mr. Payne said tonight that Mark Twain had put his affairs in perfect order, and that
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.520]   he had died well off, though by no means a rich man.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.480]   He leaves a considerable number of manuscripts in all stages of incompleteness and of all
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   characters.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.120]   Many of them began years ago and put aside as unsatisfactory.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.840]   Mrs. Gabrielowitz will aid Mr. Payne in the final decision as to what youth shall be made
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.000]   of these.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.600]   Mark Twain's career.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.920]   Long life struggles and achievements of Samuel Langhorn Clemens.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:52.420]   Samuel Langhorn Clemens was considered the best known American man of letters.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.440]   Often he was referred to as the Dean of American Literature.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.520]   He was known far beyond the boundaries where English is spoken as the greatest humorous
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.800]   and satirist living.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.680]   His famous telegram to a newspaper publishing a report of his death when happily it was
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.360]   intrigued has been quoted and re-quoted almost everywhere.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:18.760]   "The report of my death," he wired, "is greatly exaggerated."
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.680]   The father of Mark Twain was John Marshall Clemens, who migrated from Virginia to Kentucky,
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.360]   and then onto Adair County, Tennessee, when a young man.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.960]   There he married a young woman named Langhorn, who brought him family prestige and many broad
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.440]   acres.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.560]   But with the prevalent spirit of unrest among pioneers, the couple crossed over into Missouri,
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:49.120]   settling at Florida Monroe County, where their famous son was born.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.640]   Mark Twain's life, however, really did not begin until years later when the family moved
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.200]   to Hannibal, Mary, and County.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.800]   Hannibal has been described many times as a typical river town of that day, a sleepy place
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.360]   filled with drawing, lazy picturesque inhabitants, black and white.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.720]   Young Clemens saw the record runs, went to school there, and so also the record runs
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.120]   studied just as little as he could if he studied at all.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.680]   He had been painted in that period of his career as an incorrigible truant, roaming the river
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.160]   banks and bluffs, watching the passing steamboats, and listening keenly to the trials that went
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.120]   on in the shabby office, where the justice of the peace, his father, settled the disputes
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.480]   and punished the misdemeanors of his neighbors.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.560]   In that period, while the ambition to be a pilot on the great river burned in him was
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.800]   stored in his memory, the material which in after years crystallized into Tom Sawyer,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.960]   Mackelberry Finn, and Puddinhead Wilson.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.200]   Mark Twain's school days ended when he was twelve.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.120]   The father died, leaving nothing behind, save the reputation of being a good neighbor
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.920]   and an upright man, and his children at once became bread-winners.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.760]   Sam was apprenticed as a printer at fifty cents a week in the office of the Hannibal
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:16.720]   Weekly Journal, doing, as he afterwards said, a little of everything.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   After three years with a capital of a few dollars in his pocket, he became what was then
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.920]   a familiar sight, a wanderer from one printing office to another.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.800]   About this period he paid his first visit to New York, having been drawn here by stories
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.360]   of a great exposition then in progress.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.920]   He worked here for a while, then moved on to Philadelphia, and later obeying always the
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.320]   wandering instinct which finally carried him around the world and into all hands to nearly
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.600]   all the larger cities of the south and west, including New Orleans.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.520]   The trip down the river awakened the old desire to be a pilot, which had slumbered since the
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.640]   Hannibal days, and his career as a printer was ended.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.520]   He paid in cash and promised five thousand dollars to a Mississippi pilot to take him
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.800]   on as an assistant and teach him the river.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.520]   He became a pilot and stuck to it until the outbreak of the Civil War, earning two hundred
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:21.640]   and fifty dollars a month, but chief of all he got here his material for life on the Mississippi.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:27.720]   His experience as a Confederate soldier was brief and inglorious, hardly had he enlisted
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.080]   before he was captured, released on parole.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.600]   He broke the parole and returned to the ranks and soon was recaptured.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.840]   He was in imminent peril, for recognition meant immediate and ignominous execution, but he
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.800]   got away and determined never to take the risk again.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.640]   He stopped flight only on reaching Nevada, where several letters of his to the Virginia
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.800]   City enterprise resulted in an offer from the editor of that paper of a place on the staff.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.480]   From that day forward, Clemens earned his living with his pen, but with the exception
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.240]   of several excursions.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.200]   From Nevada, Mark Twain moved out to San Francisco, where, after a brief service on
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.800]   the local staff of the call, he was discharged as useless.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:22.560]   Then he and Brett Hart were associated in the conduct of the Californian, but both soon
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.640]   deserted the paper to make their fortunes mining if they could.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.440]   Neither did, and Mark Twain was soon back in San Francisco, penniless and ill.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.080]   This was in blank.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:41.080]   The Sacramento Union sent him to sandwich islands to write a blank of letters on the
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.440]   sugar trade, an arrangement which this time he filled to the editor's satisfaction and
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.640]   returned restored to health.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.920]   That winter, however, was one of roughing it for him.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.560]   He could get little to do as reporter or editor, and finally took to lecturing in a small way.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.920]   He was a success from the start.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.360]   He spoke in many of the small towns of California and Nevada, earning more than a living, and
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.680]   meantime writing sketches for Eastern papers.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:18.560]   These attracted considerable notice, and in March of 1867 he issued his first book containing
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.760]   the Jumping Frog and other stories.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.360]   Its reception was so cordial that Mark Twain decided to try his fortunes in the East.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.400]   On reaching New York, he learned that a secret excursion was about to start for the Holy Land
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.440]   in the steamer Quaker City.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.240]   He persuaded the altar California, for which he had been writing, to advance him the price
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.560]   of the ticket for this trip.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.960]   To be paid in letters at fifteen dollars each.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.520]   He made his trip, which proved the beginning of his fortune for innocence abroad.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.960]   His first famous book had taken shape in his mind before his return.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.000]   To write the book, however, and to live at the same time was a problem.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.080]   But Senator W. M. Stewart of Nevada, becoming interested in the project, obtained for him
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.800]   a six dollar a day committee clerkship while the work was farmed out to another man at
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.440]   a hundred dollars a month.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.400]   In a sense a broad, instant success.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.000]   The book was finished in August 1868, but a publisher was hard to find.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.880]   At last the American publishing company of Hartford agreed to issue it.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.480]   Its success was instant and overwhelming.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.280]   Edition after edition was sold in such rapid succession that the presses could not turn
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.320]   them out fast enough.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.280]   Mark Twain had become a man of note overnight.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.960]   Among Mark Twain's friends on the Holy Land trip had been Judge Gervis J. Langdon of Elmira,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:54.280]   New York, and his two children, Dan of the Innocence, and Lizzie.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.720]   Mark Twain fell in love with the ladder.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.540]   And it was said afterward that his desire to be near her led him to accept editorial
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.280]   connection in 1869 with the Buffalo Express.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.040]   But Judge Langdon, who was rich, did not at first favor the union of his daughter and
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.640]   the nearly penniless journalist.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.120]   And Miss Langdon, twice, rejected him.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.800]   He sought a wife as he sought a publisher, and his third proposal was accepted.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.960]   His father-in-law gave him a handsome home in Buffalo.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.160]   But the young couple remained there, but a year, going to Hartford where they lived for
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.320]   many years, where Mark Twain did perhaps his most work.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.760]   His fortune swept away.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.440]   Two years later the firm failed, and Mark Twain's fortune was swept away.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.400]   With courage as unbroken as when he could not get a job as a reporter in San Francisco,
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:52.520]   many years before, he again took to the lecture field to regain his fortunes.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:58.320]   He received generous offers to go on tour, and everywhere was greeted by large and enthusiastic
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.800]   audiences.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.000]   He made a new fortune, paid his debts, as Sir Walter Scott had done, and left the publishing
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.640]   business to others while he worked hard at his desk as ever.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:17.680]   In 1896 appeared the personal recollections of Joan of Arc, more tramps abroad, and, following
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:25.880]   the equator in 1897, and "The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg," 1900.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:32.240]   After an extended trip to Europe, he published in 1902 a double-barreled detective story.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:38.080]   And in recent years, besides writing frequently for magazines, particularly the Harper Publications,
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.760]   the Harper Brothers having been his publishers for the last decade or more, he had been engaged
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:49.200]   with Albert Biglo Payne, his literary assistant, in writing his autobiography.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.360]   Much of it has already been published.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.360]   It was estimated three years ago that he had written two hundred and fifty thousand words,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.440]   and was still turning out something like a thousand a day when he worked.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.240]   Mark Twain had outlived most of his family.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.960]   His wife died some years ago, and on the morning before Christmas, last year his daughter,
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:15.600]   Mrs. Jean Clemens, was drowned in a bathtub in their home at Reading, Connecticut.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.880]   Broken himself, in health, and utterly crushed by this sudden affliction, he wrote on that
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.040]   day.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:28.760]   She was all I had left except Clara, who married Mr. Gibberowich lately, and has just arrived
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.600]   in Europe.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:38.000]   In 1905, Mark Twain celebrated his 70th birthday with a notable gathering of literary folk.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.880]   Two years later he was honoured by Oxford University with a degree of Doctor of Laws.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   Though in his younger days he was a great traveller, and was known personally to nearly
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.200]   all the crowned heads of Europe.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.640]   Of late years he had confined his journey chiefly to Bermuda, whether he was often accompanied
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.440]   by one of his best friends, the late H. H. Rogers, as long as he lived.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.800]   In nearly all his public appearances in the last five years he had worn white flannel,
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.480]   and even had a dress suit, claw hammer, and all made of this soft white material, whose
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.880]   evident cleanliness appealed so strongly to him.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.760]   Twain as Printer's Devil His own stories of his exploits in boyhood
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.360]   as acting editor.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.480]   One of the most interesting of all Mark Twain's books or series of personal sketches related
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.960]   to the crucial but happy-go-lucky period of his life.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.000]   At twelve he began his own account.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.360]   He has told this characteristic story of his first literary venture when the Devil got
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.840]   the paper.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.320]   I was a very smart child at the age of thirteen, an unusually smart child.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.280]   I thought at the time it was then that I did my first newspaper scribbling, and most unexpectedly
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.440]   to me it stirred up a fine sensation in the community.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.800]   It did, indeed, and I was very proud of it, too.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.520]   I was a devil in a printing office, and a progressive and aspiring one.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:13.000]   My uncle had me, on his paper, the weekly Hannibal Journal, two dollars a year in advance, five
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.760]   hundred subscribers, and they paid in cordwood, cabbages, and unmarkerable turnips.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.920]   An unlucky summer day he left town to be gone a week, and asked me if I thought I could
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.960]   edit one issue of the paper judiciously.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.880]   Ah, didn't I want to try?
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.480]   Higgins was the editor on the rival paper.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.680]   He had been jilted, and one night a friend found an open note on the poor fellow's bed,
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.120]   in which he stated that he could no longer endure life, and had drowned himself in Bear
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.440]   Creek.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.160]   The friend ran down there and found Higgins waiting back to shore.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.480]   He had concluded he wouldn't.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.280]   The village was full of it for a few days, but Higgins did not suspect it.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.880]   I thought this was a fine opportunity.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.520]   I wrote an elaborately wretched account of the whole matter, and then illustrated it
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.640]   with villainous cuts engraved on the bottoms of wood-type with a jack-knife, one of them
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:12.080]   a picture of Higgins, weeding out into the creek in his shirt, with a lantern sounding
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.880]   the depth of the water with a walking stick.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.360]   Next I gently touched up the newest stranger, the lion of the day, the gorgeous journeyman
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:27.280]   Taylor from Quincy, he was a simpering coxcomb of the first water and the loudest dressed
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.920]   man in the state.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.480]   He was an inverturate woman-killer.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.360]   Every week he wrote lushy poetry for the journal about his newest conquest.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:43.160]   His rhymes for my week were headed, to marry in H1, meaning to marry in Hannibal, of course.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.360]   But while setting up the piece I was suddenly driven from head to heel, with wood I regarded
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.240]   as a perfect thunderbolt of humour, and I compressed it into a snappy footnote at the
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.640]   bottom thus.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:01.440]   We will let this thing pass just this once, but we wish Mr. J. Gordon-Runnels to understand
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.760]   distinctly that we have a character to sustain, and from this time forth, when he wants to
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:12.040]   commune with his friends in H1, he must select some other medium than the columns of this
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.480]   journal.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.400]   The paper came out, and I never knew any little thing to attract so much attention as those
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.720]   playful trifles of mine.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.680]   For once the Hannibal journal was in demand, a novelty it had not experienced before.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.600]   The whole town was stirred.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.840]   Higgins dropped in with a double-billed shotgun early in the afternoon.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.560]   When he found that it was an infant, as he called me, that had done him the damage,
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.680]   he simply pulled my ears and went away, but he threw up the situation that night and left
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.880]   town.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.000]   Associate Editor of Morning Glory
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.200]   On the advice of a physician, Mark Twain said he went south shortly after his week as
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.000]   a devil, an editor-in-chief in one, landing finally as associate editor on the Morning
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Glory in Johnson County, Tennessee.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.760]   He gave this description of his chief.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.720]   When I went on duty I found the chief editor, sitting tilted back in a three-legged chair
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.000]   with his feet on a pine table.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.240]   There was another pine table in the room and another afflicted chair, and both were half-buried
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.080]   underneath papers and scraps and sheets of manuscript.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.520]   There was a wooden box of sand sprinkled with cigar stubs and old soldiers, and a stove
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.760]   with its door hanging by its upper hinge.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:36.280]   The chief editor had a long black cloth frock coat on and white linen pants.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:41.560]   His boots were small and neatly blacked, he wore a ruffled shirt, a large seal ring,
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.960]   a standing collar of obsolete pattern, and checkered necked kerchief with ends hanging
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.960]   down.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.120]   He told me to take the exchanges and skim through them and write up the script of the
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.680]   Tennessee press.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.160]   I wrote as follows.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.280]   The editors of the semi-weekly earthquake evidently labor under mistaking apprehension
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.160]   with regard to the Ballyhach Railroad.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.040]   It is not the object of the company to leave Buzzardville off to one side.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.880]   On the contrary, they consider it one of the most important points along the line, and
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.760]   consequently have no desire to slight it.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:22.640]   The gentleman of the earthquake will, of course, take pleasure in making the correction.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.040]   I passed my manuscript over to the chief editor for acceptance, alteration or destruction.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.760]   "Thunder and lightning," he exclaimed, "do you suppose I'm going to speak of those cattle
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.760]   that way?
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.980]   Do you suppose my subscribers are going to stand such gruel as that?
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.080]   Give me the pen."
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.000]   While he was in the midst of his work, somebody shot at him, through the open window, and
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.720]   marred the symmetry of my ear.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:53.520]   "Ah!" said he, "that is that scoundrel Smith of the moral volcano."
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.560]   He was due yesterday, and he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and fired.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.040]   Smith dropped, shot through the thigh.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:06.480]   The shot spoiled Smith's aim, who was taking a second chance, and he crippled a stranger.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   It was me.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.760]   Merely a finger was shot off.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.640]   "Now, here's the way this stuff ought to be written," said the chief editor.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.080]   I took the manuscript.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.480]   It was scarred with erasures and interliniations, till its mother wouldn't have known it if
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.080]   it had had one.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.360]   It now reads as follows.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.600]   The invertebrate liars of the semi-weekly earthquake are evidently endeavoring to palm
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.560]   off a noble and chivalrous people, another of their vile and brutal falsehoods, with regard
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.760]   to the most glorious conception of the nineteenth century, the Ballyhach Railroad.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:47.080]   The idea that Buzzardville was to be left off at one side originated in their own fulsome
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.960]   brains, or rather in the setlings which they regarded as brains.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.720]   They had better swallow this lie if they want to save their abandoned reptile carcasses,
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.080]   the cow hiding they so richly deserve.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.480]   Mark Twain says he had written this way of the editor of an esteemed contemporary John
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:10.880]   W. Blossom Esquire, the able editor of the Higginsville Thunderbolt and Battlecry of
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.120]   Freedom, arrived in the city yesterday.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.080]   He is stopping at the Van Buren House.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:22.560]   His chief editor changed it to read, "That ass, Blossom, of Higginsville Thunderbolt
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.700]   and Battlecry of Freedom, is down here again sponging at the Van Buren."
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:34.200]   "Now, that is the way to write," he said, "peppery and to the point, mush and milk journalism
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.800]   gives me the fan-tuds."
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.920]   Blow to his friends here.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.560]   New York editors and authors extol the man and the writer.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.440]   The news of Samuel L. Clemens' death shocked all his friends and literary associates with
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.280]   its suddenness.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.840]   Although it had been known that he was in a serious condition, no one seemed to expect
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.720]   that his illness would terminate fatally so soon.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.280]   E. Hopkinson Smith, who has known Mr. Clemens for thirty years ever since, in fact the great
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.880]   humer's first came to the city and lectured at Cooper Union, was dining at the home of
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:16.440]   Mr. and Mrs. George Clark at 1027 Fifth Avenue when he first heard of Clemens' death.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:22.440]   "It does not seem possible that Sam is dead," said Mr. Smith, "we had been friends ever since
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:27.380]   he first came from San Francisco and gave his readings of the jumping frog on the lecture
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.180]   platform."
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.880]   He had the kindest heart in the world, the reading public knew him more for his humor,
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.080]   but his friends knew him as a big-hearted human man.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.840]   His attitude toward everyone was the kindest.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:47.280]   In life and in art, it was always the human that appealed to him most.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.800]   The humor of his books was the real, the genuine humor.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.320]   Humor to be lasting must be clean.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.920]   Clemens' humor was essentially clean.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.400]   It will be lasting for that reason.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.320]   It was the humor of human nature.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.720]   There was never anywhere in it any double entendre.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:11.440]   It was always kindly; it never ridiculed anyone; it never made fun of the little list of men.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.040]   Twain did not make fun of Tom Sawyer painting the backyard fence; he brought out the human
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.680]   note in the boy.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   And that's what makes us always remember, that passage with joy, and read it over and
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   over.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.480]   Colonel George M. Harvey of Harper and Aunt Brothers, who was Mr. Clemens' publisher,
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:37.000]   was abroad, but Henry M. Alden, editor of Harper's, at his home in Matutian, New Jersey,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   last night spoke with a motion of the man who had been not only a contributor but a friend.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.040]   In Mr. Clemens' death I have lost a dear friend, Mr. Alden said, "I feel a deep sense
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:53.080]   of personal loss, and I can't express my sense of the loss to literature.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.760]   As for our personal relations, they are much more than those of editor and contributor.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:03.880]   He could tell anything about Mark Twain better than he could tell it himself, or, indeed,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.640]   half so well.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.400]   He has always been writing his autobiography; I have always believed that literature has
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   lost much by not having had more of his imaginative creations on a higher plane.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.320]   More works like Joan of Art, for example."
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:25.400]   Mr. Alden has published his personal recollections of Mr. Clemens' in the book news monthly for
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.480]   April.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:33.240]   Mark Twain was, with one exception, the best known American of his time, and without exception
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:38.440]   outside of Poe and the New England School, he was our most distinguished writer, said
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.840]   Robert Underwood Johnson, of the century.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:47.080]   He had the singular distinction of having, so to speak, naturalized American humor in
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.920]   many lands.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.680]   This, it seems to me, was due to the fact that his humor was not greatly dependent on difficult
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:59.840]   dialects, but on large underlying ideas, and on a keen appreciation of human nature, and
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:06.280]   on a skillful use of the incongruous, in dramatic effect, in surprise, and in climax, he was
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.880]   unequalled and inexhaustible.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.600]   I think that these things are likely to give more than usual permanency to his writings.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:20.160]   We have outgrown many once-popular humorists, but I can't conceive of a generation of readers
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:25.960]   to whom on the whole his work will not be of enjoyable interest, while literally he has
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:30.440]   added to the gaiety of nations, and made us all his debtors.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:36.160]   He has also in his serious work revealed an admirable and tender sympathy for children,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.080]   and a chivalry towards the oppressed.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.960]   So much has he become a part of our lives that it is difficult to think of a world without
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.960]   Mark Twain.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:53.600]   This countryman's tributes express deep sense of what Mark Twain means to Americans.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.920]   Mark Twain's death has meant to Americans everywhere, and in all walks of life what
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.280]   the death of no other American could have meant.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.520]   His personality and his humor have been an integral part of American life for so long
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.240]   that it has seemed almost impossible to realize an America without him.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.400]   Everything of this feeling is expressed in the tributes to his memory which, following
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.860]   hard upon his end, have come from all parts of the country.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.200]   Some of these tributes are printed below.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.140]   William Lyon Phelps, professor of English literature at Yale University.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.040]   The death of Mark Twain is a very great loss to American letters.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:39.280]   I regarded him as our foremost representative in literature at the present day.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.360]   Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, his two masterpieces, will live for many years as illustrative
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.400]   of a certain phase of American life.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.760]   Colonel Thomas Wentworth of Higginson in Boston.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.800]   It is impossible to exaggerate the loss to the country.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, now in her 91st year in Boston.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.120]   The news of Mark Twain's death will be sad to many people.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.840]   He was personally highly esteemed and much beloved, a man of letters with a very genuine
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.040]   gift of humor and of serious thought as well.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.440]   Hand in Garland, novelist in Chicago.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:24.200]   Mark Twain's death marks the exit of a literary man who was as distinctly American as was Walt
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.520]   Whitman.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.320]   The work of most writers could be produced in any country, but I think we, as well as
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.200]   everybody in foreign lands, will look upon Twain's work as being as closely related
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.040]   to this country as the Mississippi River itself.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:44.000]   We who knew him personally hardly need to speak of him as a man, for all the world knew
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.240]   him.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:50.520]   No one ever heard him speak without being inspired, and no one ever saw him without being proud
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.840]   of him.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.680]   George Aide at Kentland, Indiana.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.600]   I read every line Twain wrote, for he was a kind of literary god to me.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.860]   His influence has already worked itself into the literature of our day.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.880]   We owe much of our cheerfulness, simplicity, and hope to him.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:14.540]   Most of all, Twain grew old, beautifully, showing his simple, childlike faith for ultimate
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.560]   success throughout all his adversities.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.440]   Booth Tarkington at Indianapolis.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.600]   He seemed to me the greatest prose-writer we had, and beyond that a great man.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:32.280]   His death is a national loss, but we have the consolation that he and his genius belong
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.760]   to and were of us.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.080]   Charles Major at Indianapolis.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.720]   He created a new school of humor, the purpose of which was not only to be funny, but to
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.920]   be true.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.760]   He could write nothing that he did not at least feel to be true.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.440]   All that he wrote was half fun and whole earnest.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.840]   James Whitcomb Riley.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:59.880]   The world has lost not only a genius, but a man, a striking character, of influence,
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.160]   and of boundless resources.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.460]   He knew the human heart, and he was sincere.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:10.640]   He knew children, and this knowledge made him tender.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.720]   End of Article.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.600]   This recording is in the public domain.
