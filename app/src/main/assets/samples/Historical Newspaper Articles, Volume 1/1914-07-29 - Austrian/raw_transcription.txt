[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   "Austrian Emperor to Take Command at Vienna Headquarters" from The New York Times, July
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.760]   29, 1914.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.680]   Read for Liberbox.org by James Smith.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.840]   "Austrian Emperor to Take Command at Vienna Headquarters" War Fever at Capital.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.000]   Crowds cheer outbreak of hostilities and demonstrate at friendly embassies.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.400]   "Austbreaker Food Riots" Prices soar as hostilities are declared
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000]   and the government steps in to regulate them.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.640]   "Festo from Emperor" Force to grasp the sword, he says, to defend the honor of his monarchy.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.480]   France fizz a great war.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.440]   Army moves to the frontier, belief in Paris that Russia will not desert Serbia.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.760]   Special cable to The New York Times.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.400]   Vienna, July 28.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.320]   Upon the issue of the formal declaration of war against Serbia today, Emperor Franz Josef
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.000]   gave orders for the removal of the summer court from Ishel to the capital.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.680]   His entourage tried to persuade him that Vienna air would not suit him, but the aged Emperor
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.360]   replied, "I do not want the air of Vienna, I want the atmosphere of headquarters."
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.880]   The opening of the war has caused the imposition of all kinds of restrictions upon public business.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.160]   All the railways, of course, are under military control and the telegraphs are being reserved
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   entirely for the service of the state.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.280]   The hope is still entertained here that the war will be confined to Austria-Hungary and
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.600]   Serbia, the report that Russia and France have intervened in Vienna isn't correct.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.880]   In officials circles here it has maintained that any action by those powers must be supported
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.520]   by the third party of the Triple Entente, namely Great Britain.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.320]   It is known that Great Britain and France do not want a European War, peace among the
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.400]   Great Powers or war among the Great Powers must depend on the action of St. Petersburg.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.880]   At the foreign office here it is freely stated that now that war has begun, Austria-Hungary
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.200]   will be bound to no more conditions such as sheep are pounded prior to the outbreak of
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.720]   hostilities.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.080]   Food prices up in Vienna.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.240]   There was an abnormal rise in the price of provisions today, which caused great indignation
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.040]   on the part of the public, who flocked to the markets, to lay in stores, in anticipation
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.840]   of a possible scarcity.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.960]   Vegetables in many cases travelled in price.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.160]   Feeling ran so high that in many instances stallkeepers in the marketplace were mobbed
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.200]   or assaulted and the police had to be called out to restore order.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.920]   The authorities declared that the sudden increase in the prices of provisions and vegetables
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.040]   is totally unwarranted.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.480]   A permanent committee appointed to deal with the question of provisioning the country
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.240]   sat today to discuss the regulation of prices in order to prevent the public being cheated.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.640]   A similar meeting with the same object was also held in the diet.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.600]   It was officially asserted that there was no reason for apprehension with regard to the
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.200]   food supply and that it was needless for citizens to start the accumulation of stores of provisions.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.420]   The only effect of such procedure, it was added, would be to still further raise prices.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.200]   Official arrangements have been made to take care of families of reservists called to the
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.080]   colors.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.400]   In the event of a reservist being killed or reported missing, an allowance of about twenty-five
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.680]   cents per day for each adult and twelve and a half cents a day for children will be continued
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.200]   for six months.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.560]   And of article, this recording is in the public domain.
