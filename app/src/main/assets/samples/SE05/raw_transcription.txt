[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.620]   - Hey everybody, my name is Andrew.
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.040]   - And I'm Suzanne.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.460]   - And you're listening to Q-Lips.
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.820]   Hey Suzanne.
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.900]   - Hey Andrew, how's it going?
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.260]   - I'm good, inn't you?
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.700]   - I'm so excited that we're doing
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.820]   Speak Easy episode number five.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.060]   How about that?
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.300]   - Speak Easy number five, wow.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.820]   We're moving right along with this series.
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.260]   And of course, Speak Easy is our pronunciation series
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.780]   where we tell you lots of tips and tricks
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.780]   you can use to make your English sound clearer
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.000]   and more understandable.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.500]   - Yes.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.540]   - Today, Suzanne, we are going to look
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.140]   at a really, really important factor,
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.660]   really important element of English pronunciation.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.740]   That is stress.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.580]   - Yes, in English, we're all about the stress.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.900]   That's how it works.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.260]   - We're stressed out.
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.740]   - We're totally stressed out all the term.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.100]   Today, we're gonna be talking about sentence stress.
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.660]   And this is actually part one in a series
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.660]   of Speak Easy episodes that we will do
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.300]   addressing stress.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.540]   So we're dealing with sentence stress,
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.540]   which is super important because sentence stress
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.540]   is when you emphasize certain words in your thought group,
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.660]   so you're like your thought or your sentence
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.580]   in order to convey your message more effectively.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.140]   So you're stressing like the important words
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.100]   so that your message is really understandable.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.820]   - Yeah, the grouping of stressed and unstressed words
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940]   within the context of a sentence,
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.820]   I think this is what we mean by sentence stress, right?
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.620]   The combination of stressed and unstressed words together.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.700]   - Exactly.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.460]   It's kind of like you put your foot on the gas pedal
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.020]   for some words and some you take your foot off.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.460]   So basically, there are four main things
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.180]   that we do with our voice
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.620]   in order to make a word more emphasized
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.580]   or stressed in a sentence.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.300]   - Suzanne, just before you tell us the four elements
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.900]   that make up sentence stress,
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900]   I wanna remind everyone that the study guide

[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.860]   - Okay, Suzanne, so let's get into it.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.280]   The four elements of sentence stress.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.580]   I am dying to know, what are they?
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.620]   - I know, it's so exciting.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.020]   So the first one is volume change.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.860]   - Volume change.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.900]   - Yeah, so when you stress a word,
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.180]   you might add volume,
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.900]   like where are you going, right?
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.220]   Or hey, hey, Andrew, right?
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.540]   I might change my volume, make it louder,
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.840]   or I might make it quieter as well.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.080]   So you can change your volume on the word.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.500]   The second thing you can do,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   and this is the most common,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.220]   is to change your pitch.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.420]   - Pitch.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.540]   - Pitch change, yeah.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.240]   - What is pitch?
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   - So pitch is when you change the note of your voice.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.540]   For example, you might be speaking down here
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.540]   and kind of low, and then you might go,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.780]   oh, right.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.780]   And you might change your note or pitch in your voice, right?
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.220]   It might go up, like you might say,
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.180]   where are you going?
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.340]   Where are you going?
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.900]   Right?
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.940]   This is going to emphasize that word
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.900]   that you change the pitch on.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.500]   - Okay, so the second element is pitch change.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.380]   We have volume change and pitch change.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.240]   What is the third element?
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.180]   - The third thing you can do is to elongate
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.260]   or stretch out your vowels.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.180]   - Okay.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.660]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.660]   For using the same example, you could say,
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.380]   where are you going?
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.660]   Where are you going, right?
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.820]   So you're really making that go a little bit longer.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.460]   - The vowels are just getting stretched out really long.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.460]   - Yeah, really like that movie, for example, right?
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.780]   The fourth and final thing you can do
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.780]   is you can add articulation on your consonants.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.460]   So our consonants, right?
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.060]   Like puh, tuh, cuh, and buh, duh, guh.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.620]   You can maybe add more emphasis, more intensity,
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.620]   more articulation on those sounds.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.380]   - Okay, so you're manipulating a consonant sound
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.420]   to add stress.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.420]   - Yeah, so let's say if we have the same sentence,
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.500]   like where are you going?
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.260]   You might put more, g, g, on the G.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.340]   Like more force, more push on the G.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.580]   Like where are you going?
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.380]   Where are you going?
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.780]   G, right?
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.540]   And that's more air, more intensity.
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.780]   And that can add stress to the word.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.820]   I was just thinking of an example
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.820]   of where I was stuck in traffic
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.540]   and I was really frustrated and somebody cut me off.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.740]   And I said, "Oh, come on, come on."
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.900]   - Exactly.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.620]   - You're a really strong K sound.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.380]   - Come on, yes.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.460]   And that's a great place to add articulation, right?
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.100]   When you're angry, right?
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.860]   - That's a good time.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.540]   'Cause end volume, you might change your volume too.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.060]   Usually you don't change your pitch so much
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.380]   when you're angry, but more the volume
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.220]   and the added articulation.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.220]   - Yeah, for example, if I was talking on my cell phone
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.820]   to my friend who was waiting for me at the cafe
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.580]   and maybe my friend said, "Well, where are you?
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.500]   "You're late."
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.100]   And I would say, "Oh, I'm coming right now," right?
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.100]   That would, I wouldn't use the same emphasized sound
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.580]   in that context, but it's the same word.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.340]   So yeah, this is just an example
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.300]   of that added articulation on a consonant sound.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.980]   - Yes, perfect.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.300]   - Okay, so the plan for today is that we are going to listen
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.900]   to a conversation example between two roommates
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.580]   and they are deciding about what they should eat
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.860]   for dinner, actually.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.420]   So we will listen to that example
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.580]   and then we're going to pick it apart
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.060]   and really look at where the stress was
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.220]   in their speech and talk about it
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.580]   and describe how our listeners can also incorporate
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.220]   these elements into their own speech
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.380]   when they are speaking English.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.620]   Does that sound good?
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.180]   - Sounds awesome.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.340]   - Cool, so let's listen to the example right now.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.900]   - Hey, Rumi, let's go get a bite.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.740]   I'm starved.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.420]   - Good idea.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.220]   Where do you want to go?
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.060]   - There's a nice Italian place about a block from here.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.500]   - Are you set on Italian?
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.580]   What about a Thai place?
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.020]   - Oh, do you know one?
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.340]   - I sure do.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.780]   It's new.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.940]   The food is delicious and they deliver.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.700]   Great, let's order.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:06.060]   - Now that we've heard the example,
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.060]   Andrew, I wanted to ask you if maybe you can point out
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.500]   any examples of volume change
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.300]   on the words that were emphasized.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.540]   - So in this conversation,
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.220]   we heard two roommates talking about getting a bite to eat
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.460]   and one of the roommates suggested,
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.620]   hey, let's eat, I'm hungry.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.420]   Once one of the roommates said, great idea, good idea.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.060]   I think this was an example of volume change.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.900]   We heard this articulated a little bit louder
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.620]   when she agreed with him.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.540]   - Yeah, because I think she was really thinking
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.460]   that's a great idea, like almost like,
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.380]   so glad you said that, you know?
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.340]   - Let's listen to that part of the conversation again
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.180]   one more time.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.740]   Good idea.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.900]   Where do you wanna go?
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.700]   Good idea.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.860]   Where do you wanna go?
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:09.020]   - Yeah, so we definitely hear some volume change there.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.980]   And also I heard the volume change
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.660]   at the very end of the conversation
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.460]   when the two roommates decided about eating
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.540]   at a Thai place instead of an Italian place.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.700]   Now let's listen to that part of the conversation
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.060]   at the very end, one more time.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.540]   - Great, let's order.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.260]   Great, let's order.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:40.180]   So yeah, Sue, did you hear the volume change there?
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.180]   - Yeah, so I think at the end,
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.460]   the roommate says, great, let's order.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.660]   I think the volume was slightly louder.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.580]   Okay, so the second element of sentence stress
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.100]   is pitch change, pitch change.
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.300]   So where did you hear pitch change in this conversation?
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.620]   - Now pitch change is one of the most common,
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.620]   if not the most common element of stress.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.620]   When the roommate that is hungry
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.620]   offers a nice Italian place, a Italian place,
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.100]   there's a bit of a pitch change.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.300]   I think then when the other roommate offers,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   what about a Thai place?
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.300]   A Thai, and she goes up a little bit in her pitch as well.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.660]   - Right, because these are questions, right?
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.020]   Also like, where do you wanna go?
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.620]   Where do you wanna go?
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.460]   - Yeah.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.740]   - You have that rising intonation,
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.620]   that rising pitch when we're asking a question.
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.100]   - Exactly, and also when she asks,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.420]   are you set on Italian?
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.380]   What about a Thai place?
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.780]   Because if you think about it,
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.780]   she's kind of comparing and contrasting those two kinds of food.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.820]   So she's really emphasizing those
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.580]   by using a comparison contrasting tone, right?
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.780]   Set on Italian, what about a Thai place?
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.620]   I mean, I wish almost I had a piano here to illustrate,
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.620]   but what about a Thai place?
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.900]   Da, da, da, da, da, da, right?
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.740]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.340]   So you're hitting on another concept
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.660]   that we're going to talk about soon,
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.420]   and that's intonation.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.860]   Right now, intonation is just one element of stress,
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.340]   but when we get more in depth about intonation,
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.740]   we're gonna talk about the different notes
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.620]   that occur within English pitch change.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.820]   So we'll get into that.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.820]   - So we'll save that for a later time.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.820]   - Yeah, but you're very astute, Andrew, that's good.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.500]   - Getting ahead of myself here.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.060]   The third element that we're talking about today, though,
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.580]   is elongated vowels, stretching vowels.
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.580]   And so, did you hear any stretched vowels
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.620]   in this conversation?
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.420]   - Yeah, I definitely heard a stretched vowel on,
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.300]   oh, do you know one?
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.500]   - Oh, yeah, let's listen to that part
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.420]   of the conversation one more time.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.340]   Oh, do you know one?
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.420]   Oh, do you know one?
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.020]   So it wasn't just, oh, right?
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.580]   It's not, oh, it's like, oh, oh, do you know one?
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.540]   - Oh, yeah, exactly.
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.380]   So it's a longer vowel.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.740]   - Mm-hmm, I also think the very first word that we heard.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.100]   Hey, roomy, hey, hey, right, not hey.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:13:59.940]   - Yeah.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.460]   - Hey, but hey.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.060]   - Totally.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.060]   Let's look at the fourth and final element.
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.740]   So we have added articulation on consonants.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.060]   I don't know about you, Andrew,
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.060]   but I heard the st, st, when the roommate said,
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.980]   I'm starved, the starved, right?
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.980]   - I'm starved, really prolonging that release
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.780]   of the S sound, right?
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.460]   I'm starved, starved.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.980]   - Yes, the ST combination, exactly.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.700]   And also when the other roommate said,
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.020]   offered about the Thai place,
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:45.020]   she said, the food is delicious, delicious.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.420]   And they deliver, right?
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.420]   Like, delicious, really, really milk to those consonants.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.300]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.100]   - Cool, Andrew.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.100]   So that about wraps up our fifth speak easy episode
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.420]   on sentence stress.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.580]   How to stress a word.

[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.340]   Now that we know how to stress a word,
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.420]   now we need to know what word to stress.
