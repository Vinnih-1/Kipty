[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   From The New York Times
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   dated September 9, 1888
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   recorded for Liberbox.org by Leanne Howlett.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Old World News by Cable
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   White Chappell startled by a fourth murder from our own correspondent.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   London, September 8.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Not even during the riots in fog of February, 1886
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   have I seen London so thoroughly excited as it is tonight.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   The White Chappell Fiend murdered his fourth victim this morning
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and still continues undetected, unseen, and unknown.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   There is a panic in White Chappell, which will instantly extend to other districts
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   should he change his locality, as the four murders are in everybody's mouth.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   The papers are full of them, and nothing else is talked of.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   The latest murder is exactly like its predecessor.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   The victim was a woman streetwalker of the lowest class.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   She had no money, having been refused lodgings shortly before because she lacked eight pints.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Her throat was cut so completely that everything but the spine was severed,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   and the body was ripped up, all the viscer being scattered about.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   The murder in all its details was inhuman to the last degree,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   and, like the others, could have been the work only of a bloodthirsty beast in human shape.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   It was committed in the most daring manner possible.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   The victim was found in the backyard of a house in Hanbury Street at six o'clock.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   At five fifteen, the yard was empty.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   To get there, the murderer must have led her through a passageway
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   in the house full of sleeping people, and murdered her within a few yards
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   of several people sleeping by open windows.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   To get away, covered with blood as he must have been,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   he had to go back to the passageway and into a street filled with early market people,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   spittle fields being close by.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Nevertheless, not a sound was heard, and no trace of the murderer exists.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   All day long, White Chapel has been wild with excitement.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   The four murders have been committed without a gunshot of each other,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   but the detectives have no clue.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   The London police and detective force is probably the stupidest in the world.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   The man called Leather Apron, of whom I cabled you, is still at large.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   He is well known, but they have not been able to arrest him,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and he will doubtless do another murder in a day or so.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   One clue discovered this morning by a reporter may develop into something.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   An hour and a half after the murder, a man with bloody hands, torn shirt,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and a wild look entered a public house half a mile from the scene of the murder.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   The police have a good description of him and are trying to trace it.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   The assassin, however, is as cunning as he is daring.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Both in this, and in the last murder, he took but a few minutes to murder his victim in a spot
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   which had been examined but a quarter of an hour before.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Both the character of the deed and the cool cunning alike exhibit the qualities of a monomaniac.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Such a series of murders has not been known in London for a hundred years.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   There is a bare possibility that it may turn out to be something like the case of Jekyll and Hyde,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   as Joseph Taylor, a perfectly reliable man who saw the suspected person this morning in a shabby dress
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   swears that he has seen the same man coming out of a lodging house in Wilton Street,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   very differently dressed.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   However, that may be, the murders are certainly the most ghastly and mysterious known to English police history.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   What adds to the weird effect they exert on the London mind is the fact that they occur
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   while everybody is talking about Mansfield's Jekyll and Hyde at the Lyceum.
