[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   Mark Twain, from the New York Times, April 22, 1910, recorded for Libravox.org by Lindaloo.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.040]   That Samuel L. Clemens was the greatest American humorous to his age, nobody will deny, but
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.680]   austerity will be left to decide his relative position and letters among the humorous of
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.720]   English literature. It is certain that his contemporary fame abroad was equal to his
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.000]   fame at home. All Europe recognized as genius, the English people appreciated him at his
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.040]   own worth, and the University of Oxford honored him with a degree. His writings commanded a
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.440]   higher price in the market than those of any other contemporary whose career was solely
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.240]   devoted to literature. His public was the enormous extent. From the jumping frog to
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.080]   the diary of Adam, everything that came from his pen was eagerly read and heartily enjoyed
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.200]   by multitudes. Much that he wrote has already been forgotten, inevitably, and in spite of
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.720]   definitive editions and the admirably practical management of his business in the later years
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.800]   of his career. But nearly all that Jonathan Swift, Fielding, Stern, and Smallet wrote
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.800]   has been forgotten, through their fame, resting on a few books, still lives. Art on the sword,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.520]   Mark Twain's greatest predecessor as a national jester, is now a little more than the name.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.480]   As be belonged exclusively to the Reconstruction period. For any American humorous writer, it
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.680]   would be fit to compare with Mark Twain. We must go back to Washington Irving. But the
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.840]   author of Niggabocker's Ironically History and the Sleepy Hollow Legend did not surpass
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.400]   those denotements of the humorous genius, the author of The Adventures of a Cup Pilot
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.680]   on the Mississippi and Huckleberry Finn. Indeed, it is hard to say that Irving ever
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.320]   surpassed Clemens. That belittling the first great American prose writer, where I compelled
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.360]   to doubt if posterity will name him in the same breath with a humerus to us just passed
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.120]   away. Innocence abroad and a tramp abroad are likely to be remembered among the great
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.000]   travel books of all time. Full of the audacity, the wild exaggeration and violent contrasts,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.840]   which distinguish the national humor, they are equally remarkable as a voracious record
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.440]   of fresh impressions on a fertile and responsive mind.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.360]   Mr. Clemens is more serious works, such as the Prince and the Popper, and incursion into
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.920]   the field of historical romance. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur and Joan of Arc
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.120]   have been read by multitudes with great delight. He has been quoted in common conversation
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.360]   often or perhaps than any of his fellow countrymen, including Benjamin Franklin and Lincoln.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.440]   He has been honored by misquotations too, and the humerus sayings of the ancients that
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.000]   have been attributed to him, though he never borrowed. His wit was his own, and so was his
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.960]   extravagance, and his powers of observation never failed him. We have called him the greatest
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.320]   American humorist. We may leave it in open question whether he was not also the greatest
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.920]   American writer of fiction, the creator of Mulberry Sellers and Put 'n Head Wilson.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   In venture that southwestern feud in Huckleberry Finn, which with all its wildly imaginative
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.400]   details, is still infused with rare pathos, has certainly an undying vitality. An emotional
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.080]   and quite unconventional sort of man, Clemens was, whose early life was a hard struggle
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.320]   for existence. He obtained his education where he could get it, presumably his faults were
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.000]   as large as his merits. Intellectually he was herculean proportions. His death will
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.240]   be mourned everywhere, and smiles will break through the tears as remembrance of the man's
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.520]   rich gift to his era comes to the mourners' minds. However his work may be judged by impartial
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:05.080]   and unprejudiced generations. His fame is imperishable, and of article. His recording
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.200]   is in the public domain.
