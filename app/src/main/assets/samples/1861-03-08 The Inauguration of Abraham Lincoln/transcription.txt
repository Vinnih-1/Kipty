[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, from the farmer's cabinet.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Friday, March 8, 1861, read for LibraVox.org by Karen Savage.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Washington March 4, the day was ushered in by a most exciting session of the Senate
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   that bodies sitting for twelve hours from seven o'clock yesterday evening to seven o'clock this morning.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   As the hands of the clock pointed to twelve o'clock last night,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   and the Sabbath gave way to Monday the fourth of March,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   the Senate chamber presented a curious and animated appearance.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   The galleries were crowded to completion.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   The ladies' gallery resembling from the gay dresses of the fair ones they're congregated,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   some gorgeous partare of flowers, and the gentlemen's gallery seemed one dense,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   black mass of surging, heaving, masculine, pushing, struggling,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and almost clambering over each other's backs in order to get a good look at the proceedings.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Some most ludicrous scenes were the result of the intense desire of the outsiders
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   to get a peep into the Senate chamber, and the per tenacity with which the
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   applicant for admission to the overflowing galleries would urge that he had
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   come all the way from Indiana or Vermont, or some other place,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   afforded the seated ones in tense amusement.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   On the floor, Messier's Crittenden, Trumbull, Wigfall, Wade, Douglas,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and others kept up a rolling fire of debate, while those not engaged in the discussion
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   be took themselves to the sofa's for a comfortable nap during the session,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   which it was known would last all night.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   As the morning advanced, the galleries and floor became gradually cleared out,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   when in the gray morning light the Senate took a recess till ten o'clock today.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   A few minutes after seven o'clock, but few remained.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   The morning broke clear and beautiful, and though at one time a few drops of rain fell,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   the day proved just calm and cloudy enough to prevent the usual heat of the past few days,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   and the whirlwind of dust that would otherwise render it excessively unpleasant.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   The public buildings, schools, places of business, etc., were closed throughout the day.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   The stars and stripes floated from the city hall, capital,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   war department, and other public buildings, while not a few of the citizens flung out flags from their houses
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   or across the principal avenues.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   From early dawn, the Drummond 5 could be heard in every quarter of the city,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and the streets were thronged with volunteer soldiers hastening to their respective rendezvous.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Three or four hours elapsed before there was the least chance of entering the capital.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Pennsylvania Avenue was thronged with people,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   winding their way to the famous East Front. For four hours, the crowd poured on toward the capital
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   in one continuous stream of old and young, male and female,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   stayed old Quakers from Pennsylvania, going to see friend Abraham,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and lengthy suckers, who's yours and Wolverines desire us of a peep at Mr. Lincoln,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Buckeyes and Yankees men from the Northeast and the Northwest, and a few from the border states.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   The large majority, however, were northern men.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   There being but few southerners judging from the lack of long-haired men in the crowd.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   The order of arrangements, as settled by the Committee of Arrangements, was as follows.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   To the left of the vice president were the Committee of Arrangements.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Immediately behind them, the heads of the various departments of the government.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Senators and members elective the House of Representatives,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   officers of the Army and Navy, governors of the states and territories,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   comped rollers, auditors, registers and solicitors of the Treasury. To the right of the vice president,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   were the judges of the Supreme Court, Senators, Diplomatic Corps,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   ex-governors of states, assistant secretaries of departments, commissioners, judges,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   and mayors of Georgetown and Washington.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Previous to the arrival of the procession, the Senate chamber did not present a very animated appearance.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   The many ladies waiting to see the display did not arrive till late,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   and the officers whose gay uniforms and flashing epolites relieved so well the
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   somberness of the national black were with the presidential courteige during the passing of the
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   procession to Willard's hotel and the march fence to the Capitol.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Senator Bright killed in the most approved manner, a certain gas bill,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   to wit by talking it to death. This not proving very interesting,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   matters waxed somewhat dull in the interim.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   At five minutes to twelve o'clock Vice President Breckenridge and Senator Foot of the Committee of
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   arrangements entered the Senate chamber, escorting the vice president elect Honorable
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Hannibal Hamlin, whom they conducted to a seat immediately to the left of the chair of the
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   president of the Senate. As the hands of the clock pointed to the hour of
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   twelve, the hammer fell and the second session of the 36th Congress came to an end.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Vice President Breckenridge bid the Senate farewell and then administered the oath of
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   vice president Hamlin. This ceremony is described in the Senate report.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Mr. Breckenridge then announced the Senate adjourned without day and left the chair to
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   which he immediately conducted vice president Hamlin.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Honorable Mr. Klingman was then sworn in as senator from the state of North Carolina.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Messier's Clark for New Hampshire, Chase for Ohio, Harris of New York,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Harlan for Iowa, Howe for Wisconsin, Breckenridge for Kentucky, Lane for Indiana,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Nessmith for Oregon, and Mitchell for Arkansas. At this juncture,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   the members and members elect of the House of Representatives entered the Senate
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   chamber, filling every available place to the left of the vice president.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The Foreign Diplomatic Corps also entered the chamber at the same moment,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   occupying seats to the right of the chair. It was a subject of general remark
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   that the Foreign Corps never was so fully represented as on this occasion.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   The minister's attachées and others numbered in all some 50 and over, and their
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   brilliancy of dress, the number of their decorations, crepes, etc., added
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   much to the imposing nature of the scene. Some of the court uniforms were
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   particularly gorgeous and attracted much attention. The scene in the Senate, while
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   waiting the arrival of the presidential party, seemed to realize the lying down
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   of the lamb and the lion together, or the mingling of oil and water.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   There's Chase, Wake Fall, Crittin'ton, Wilson, and others hobnobbing
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   with the utmost cordiality. Senator Breckenridge was conversing
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   familiarly with the extremist men of the republicans, while ladies of all
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   political affinities, Mrs. Hamlin, among them, looked smilingly down upon
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   the animated scene below. The attendance of senators was usually full,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   the only absence is noticed, being those of Messier's Mason and Hunter of Virginia.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   At 15 minutes to one o'clock, the judges of the Supreme Court of the United
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   States of America were announced by the doorkeeper of the Senate. On their
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   entrance, all on the floor arose, and the venerable judges, headed by the
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Chief Justice Taney, moved slowly to the seats assigned them immediately
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   to the right of the vice president, each exchanging salutes with that officer
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   in passing the chair. At ten minutes after one o'clock, an unusual
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   stir occurred in the chamber, and the rumors spread like wildfire that the
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   president-elect was in the building. At 15 minutes past one o'clock,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   the marshal and chief major BB French entered the chamber, ushering in the
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   president and the president-elect. They had entered together from the street
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   through a private covered passageway on the north side of the Capitol,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   police officers being in attendance to prevent outsiders from crowding after them.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   The line of procession was then formed in the following manner.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Marshal of the District of Columbia, judges of Supreme Court and Sergeant
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   at Arms, Senate Committee of Arrangements, President of the United States
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and to President-elect, Vice President, Secretary of the Senate,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Senators, diplomatic corps, heads of the departments, governors and
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   others in the chamber. When the word was given for members of the house to fall
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   into the line of procession, a violent rush was made for the door, accompanied by
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   loud outcries, violent pushing and great disturbance. After the procession
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   had reached the platform, Senator Baker of Oregon, introduced Mr. Lincoln
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   to the Assembly. On Mr. Lincoln advancing to the stand, he was cheered,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   but not very loudly. Unfolding his manuscript in a loud, clear voice,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   he read his message as follows. President Lincoln's inaugural address.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Fellow citizens of the United States, in compliance with a custom as old as the
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly and to take
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   to be taken by the president before he enters upon the duties of his office.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   that by the accession of a Republican administration, their property and their
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   permanent peace and security are to be endangered. There has never been any
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of these speeches when I
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   declare that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   the institution of slavery in the states where it exists. I believe I
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   have no lawful right to do so and I have no inclination to do so.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and more than this they placed in the platform for my acceptance and as a
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   law to themselves and to me the clear and emphatic resolution which I
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   now read. Resolved that the maintenance in violet of the
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   rights of the states and especially the right of each according to its own
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   judgment exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend and we denounce
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   the lawless invasion by an armed force of any state or territory
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   pretext as the greatest of crimes. I now reiterate
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   these sentiments and in doing so I only press upon the public attention
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   property piece and security of no section are to be in any wise
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   endangered by the now incoming administration. Add to that
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   all the protection which consistently with the constitution and the laws can be
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   given will be cheerfully given to all states when lawfully demanded for
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   whatever cause as cheerfully to one section is to another. There is much
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   controversy about delivering up fugitives from service or labor
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   the clause I now read is as plainly written in the constitution as
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   any other of its provisions. No person held to service or labor
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   showing consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   service or labor but shall be delivered up on a claim of the party to whom
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   service or labor may be due. It is scarcely questioned
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   fugitive slaves and the intention of the law giver as the law.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   All members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   to this provision as much to any other to the proposition then
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   up their oaths are unanimous. Now if they would make the effort in good
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   favor could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   of which to keep good that unanimous oath? There is some difference of opinion
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   but surely that difference is not a very material one. If the slave is to be
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   surrendered it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   authority it is done and should anyone in any case be content that his oath
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   should be uncapped on a merely substantial controversy as to how it shall be kept.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Again in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   known and civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced so that a free man
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   be not in any case surrendered as a slave and might it not be well at the same
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   which guarantees that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states. I take the official
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   oath today with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   constitution or the laws by any hypocritical rules and while I do not choose now to
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced I do suggest
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   that it will be much safer for all both in official and private stations to
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   of them trusting to find impunity and having them held to be unconstitutional.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   It is 72 years since the first inauguration of a president under our national
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   constitution during that period 15 different and greatly distinguished citizens
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   have in succession administered the executive branch of the government.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   They have conducted it through many perils and generally with great success
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   yet with all this scope of precedent I now enter upon the same task
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   of the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   difficulties. A disruption of the federal union here to for only
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   menist is now formatively attempted. I hold that in contemplation of universal law
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had provision
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the expressed
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   provisions of our national constitution and the union will endure forever.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Again if the United States be not a government proper but an association
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   of states in the name of a contract merely can it as a contract be peacefully
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate or break it so to speak
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   The union is much older than the constitution. It was formed in fact by the
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   articles of association in 1774.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   It was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   plited and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Confederation in 1778 and finally in 1787.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   One of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   was to form a more perfect union but if destruction of the union by one or
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less than before the
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   It follows from these views that no state upon its own mere
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   of the United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   and to the extent of my ability I shall take care as the constitution itself
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   expressly enforces upon me that the laws of the United States be faithfully executed
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   in all the states. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   and I shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters, the American
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   people shall withhold the requisition or in some authoritative manner direct
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself. In doing
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   forced upon the national authority. The power confided to me will be used to hold,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and collect
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   will be no invasion, no using the force against or among the people anywhere.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Where hostility to the United States in any interior territory shall be so
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   great and so universal as to prevent the competent resident citizens from holding
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   people that object. While the strict legal right may exist for the government to
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   and so nearly impracticable with all that I deem it better to forgo for a time the use of
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   such offices. The males unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   parts of the union so far as possible. The people everywhere shall have that sense
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   The course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   actually existing and with a view and a hope to a peaceful solution of the
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   national trouble and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   at all events and are glad of any pretext to do so I will neither affirm
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   or deny but if there should be such I need address no word to them.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   To those however who really love the union may I not speak?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Before entering upon so grave a matter is the destruction of our national fabric
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be well to ascertain
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   While the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Will you risk the commission of such a fearful mistake?
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   All protest to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   is it true then that any right plainly written in the Constitution has been denied?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   I think not happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   the audacity of doing this think if you can of a single instance
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   if by mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   it certainly would if such right were a vital one but such is not the case
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   all the vital rights of minorities and individuals are so plainly assured to them
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   by affirmations and negatives guarantees and prohibitions in the Constitution
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   that controversies never arise concerning them
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   which may occur in the practical administration no foresight can anticipate
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or state authority
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   the Constitution does not expressly say must Congress protect slavery in the territories
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   the Constitution does not expressly say from questions of this class spring
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   all our constitutional controversies and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   if the minority will not acquiesce the majority must or the government will cease
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   there is no other alternative for continuing the government but acquiescence on the one side or the other
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   there was no other alternative for continuing the government but acquiescence on the one side or other
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   if a minority in such a case will secede rather than acquiesce
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   for instance why may not a portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   precisely as a portion of the present union now claims to secede from it
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   is there such perfect identity of interest among the states to compose a new union
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and always changing easily with the deliberate changes of popular opinion and sentiment
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   is the only true sovereign of a free people
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   unanimity is impossible
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   the rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement is wholly inadmissible
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   so that rejecting the majority principle anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   I do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   as to the object of that suit
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   while they are also entitled to very high-respect in considerations in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   still the evil effect following it being limited to that particular case
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   with the chance that it may become a precedent for other cases can better be born than could the evils of a different practice
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   is to be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the supreme court
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties and personal actions
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   the people will have ceased to be their own rulers
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   this is the only substantial dispute the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   are each as well enforced perhaps as any laws can be in a community where the moral sense of the people in perfectly
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   supports the law itself
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases and a few break over in each
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   this I think cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after a separation of the sections than before
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   the foreign slave trade now imperfectly suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   while fugitive slaves now only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at all by the other
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   physically speaking we cannot separate we cannot remove our respective sections from each other
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   nor build an impassable wall between them a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and reach of each other
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   but the different parts of our country cannot do this they cannot but remain face to face and intercourse
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   either amicable or hostile relations must continue between them
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   is it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than law can among friends
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   suppose you go to war you cannot fight always and when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either you cease fighting
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   the identical questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   this country with its institutions belongs to those who inhabit it
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   whenever they grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   amending or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   I cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   desirous of having the national constitution amended while I make no recommendation of amendment
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I fully recognize the authority of the people over the whole subject to the
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   exercised and either of the moats prescribed in the instrument itself
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   and I should under existing circumstances favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   instead of only permitting them to take a proposition originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and which might not be precisely such as they wished to either accept or refuse
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I understand a proposed amendment to the constitution which amendment I have not seen
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   has passed Congress to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with a domestic institutions of the states
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   including that of persons held to service
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   to avoid misconstruction of what I have said I now depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   so far as to say that holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   the people themselves can do this alone if they choose
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   but the executive as such has nothing to do with it
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   his duty is to administer the present government as it came to his hands
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   is there any better or equal hope in the world in our present differences
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   is either party without faith of being in the right
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   if the almighty ruler of nations will with his eternal truth and justice
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   be on your side of the north or on yours of the south
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   by the frame of the government under which we live
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   the same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   and have with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands and intervals
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   while the people retain virtue and vigilance no administration of any extreme of wickedness or folly
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   can very seriously impair the government in the short space of four years
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   my countrymen one in all think calmly and well upon the whole subject
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   nothing valuable can be lost by taking time
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   that object will be frustrated by taking time
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   but no good object can be frustrated by it
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaired
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and on the sensitive point for laws of your own framing under it
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   while the new administration have no immediate power if it would to change either
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   there still is no single good reason for precipitate action
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I am loath to close we are not enemies but friends
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   we must not be enemies
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   though passion may have strained it must not break our bands of affection
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   the mystic call of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and heart stone
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   intelligence patriotism Christianity and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favorite land
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulties
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   the government will not assail you you can have no conflict without yourselves being the aggressors
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect and defend it
