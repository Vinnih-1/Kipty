[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Hello everyone and welcome back to the Qloops English podcast.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.920]   You're listening to Simplified Speech, our series which features clear, natural and easy to understand
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.360]   English conversations that are designed to help take your English to the next level.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.760]   Joining me today is my co-host from the USA. It's Indiana. Hey there, Indiana. How are you?
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.160]   Hi, Andrew. I'm doing really good today. How's it going with you?
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.240]   I am doing excellent. Thank you for asking. And Indiana, in this episode, we're going to complain.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:40.640]   We're going to complain. We're going to talk about things that get on our nerves. Things
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.880]   that get on our nerves. And maybe we should start with a definition. What does this mean if something
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.720]   gets on your nerves? When something gets on your nerves, it just means that it affects you
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.720]   in a way that makes you feel really irritated or annoyed or aggravated. All of these are negative
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.760]   adjectives to describe that you're upset and a little bit angry about something.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.200]   Like, why is that guy doing this? Why did she say that? It just sort of rubs you the wrong way,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.360]   another difficult expression, but it makes you feel just kind of upset in this angry way,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.640]   gets on my nerves. What would be a typical example of something that would get on someone's nerves?
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.560]   Not necessarily your nerves, Andrew, but a common one that is annoying, irritating.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.160]   First one that comes to mind is like people with bad table manners, maybe chewing with their
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.360]   mouth open, making a lot of sounds when they eat. In the culture of English-speaking countries,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.440]   we usually feel like that's a rude thing to do, and that kind of gets on my nerves if somebody is
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:01.120]   really chewing loudly and making a lot of mouth sounds. I would agree with that. That can be pretty
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.720]   irritating. Something that gets on my nerves is actually, I'm going to get on my own nerves
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.920]   here in this episode because I don't really like it when people complain a lot, but I think I'm
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.440]   going to complain a lot in this episode. I'm going to get on my own nerves and bother myself here
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   in this episode, but it's okay. I think it'll be a fun conversation. Indiana will go back and
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.040]   forth and we'll share about some of the things that get on our nerves and we'll get started with
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.960]   that in just a sack. But before we do, guys, I want to let you know there's a helpful study guide
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.520]   and an interactive transcript and a speaking class for this episode. You can get help with

[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:21.280]   without you. So thank you so much. Okay, Indiana, it's time to complain. I just said that complaining
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.640]   gets on my nerves and you know, it's like, if it's just like a little complaint once in a while,
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.800]   that's natural. That's okay. But I think we all know constant complainers, people who just
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.080]   complain about everything, like, nothing's going their way in life. Everything's somebody else's fault
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   and it's just like, complain, complain, complain. I just find that that really brings me down,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.560]   bums me out. And I don't know. I try as much as I can. I try to surround myself with positivity
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.920]   and positive people. And I feel like constant complainers drag me down and zap my energy. So
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.000]   I find that a little bit annoying personally. Yeah, I agree. If all you're bringing to the table is
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.680]   negative energy and complaining, and it's not balanced out with some positive constructive energy,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.080]   that could be a very draining relationship to have. Yeah, I'm not a fan of it either.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:25.840]   Yeah, I'm definitely a glass half full kind of guy. So I try to think of the positive side of
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.800]   things. So yeah, that's one thing that gets on my nerves. How about you? What's something that gets
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.720]   on your nerves? It is very irritating, I think, because like you said, you know, when people are
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.200]   always complaining, they're not bringing something positive to your relationship or your interaction.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.640]   Like, when I'm trying to have a conversation with somebody or tell somebody about something,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.280]   or we're both, you know, having a back and forth dialogue. And then the other person starts using
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.320]   their phone while I'm talking, or yeah, they're distracted and not paying attention. They answer
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.000]   a text or they're looking something up and not listening anymore. That really, really gets on
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   my nerves, really bugs me. Like, it's just so rude and like, okay, well, why am I here talking
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.880]   with you? You're just going to use your phone. Like, come on. It really bugs me.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.800]   Yeah, it's weird how it became so socially acceptable. If you were to do anything else,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.840]   like if you were to just pull out a book out of your bag and start reading a book mid conversation,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.120]   that would be insane, right? You'd be like, what's going on here? But for some reason,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.760]   the phone, like, we can do that. And, you know, some people don't mind me personally. I'm
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.440]   right there with you, Indiana. I think it's quite rude. And I really, really try to never look at
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.040]   my phone when I'm hanging out with people. So I'm right there with you, but it is weird that that
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.040]   is a thing. And I also find that it gets on my nerves. Another one I have, and then I want to hear
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:03.520]   some of the things that bug you. There's something about certain English expressions that I would call
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:12.800]   cliches. So I think I should define what a cliche is. This is a saying or an expression or an idiom
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.000]   that is has been used way too many times. It's been used so many times that when you hear it,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.600]   you're like, that's so unoriginal. I've heard that a million times. And it kind of actually
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.160]   maybe feels bad or negative. I don't want to hear that again. So there are certain cliches in English
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:40.000]   that kind of get on my nerves. So, for example, if I'm on Instagram and I see a very cute post
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.160]   between a boyfriend, girlfriend, or fiancé's, and it's like their anniversary or something,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.200]   and somebody's posted, I love you to the moon and back. It just bugs me. And I can't even explain
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:01.120]   why, but that cliche, it's so corny. It's so cheesy. It really makes me just like, it's cute,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.760]   but I totally, I totally understand. Yeah, it's like just a strong reaction. I can't even control.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:15.200]   I'm like, oh, don't say that. I love you to the moon and back. Yeah, do you have any expressions or
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:22.400]   yeah, are there any cliches that bother you, Andrew? I'm sure there are, but none immediately
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:29.760]   jump to mind. But I may sound like a jerk for saying this. And I realized that the intention
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:36.000]   is probably good, probably good. And I should say probably because I don't know, but you were
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.360]   just talking about Instagram posts and I'm off the gram now. I've deleted Instagram off my phone,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.640]   and I haven't been using it for like the last two months. So I feel great about that. I got a lot of
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   clarity in my life and some free time back because I stopped using Instagram. But when I was using
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.480]   Instagram, you know, occasionally you'll have a buddy who makes a public post about his wife's
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.560]   birthday. You know, it's my wife's birthday. Like, let's celebrate her. And she's so amazing. And
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.760]   blah, blah, blah, blah. And I know like that's kind of nice. But like, I don't know, that always just,
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.720]   I thought was so cheesy. And a little bit gets on my nerves, because I feel like it's not authentic,
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.440]   like, I don't know. Like, if you do that, it's great to celebrate your partner. I realized that
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.400]   it's just me being a jerk. But it feels like performative. Yeah, like you're doing it to like
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.440]   get some credit back, like look at what a great husband I am at the same time. So I don't know,
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.480]   that always sort of like that expression you used earlier rubbed me the wrong way. It's not like
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:47.440]   I'm angry about it. But at the same time, I'm always like, a little bit weird. I don't know.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:55.360]   It's true. It's like you're conforming to this expectation or you see that other people are
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.800]   posting about their wives or husbands and like, you're like, Oh, I better do that too. But it takes the
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.000]   meaning out of it if everybody does that all the time and it's expected. That's what I don't like
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.120]   the expectation. Yeah. Like on Mother's Day, I always see these posts like, I love my mom so
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.160]   much. And like, it's like, well, I obviously love my mom too. But it makes the more posts I see
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.200]   that are like, Oh, mom, you're the best mom ever. The more that I want to just log off,
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.040]   call my mom privately. Nobody can see that I love my mom. I don't want to make it this
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.680]   performative thing. Yeah, I agree completely. Yeah. So that that's always something that
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.320]   I don't want to say that it gets on my nerves. But I always thought is a little strange,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:46.560]   those kind of performative public posts. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Let me think, what else? I made
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:53.840]   a note here, dog stuff, dog stuff. So listeners will know that my wife and I adopted a dog.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.320]   Yeah, we've had a dog since May of this year. So for several months now. And so that means we
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   walk her often, like usually three times a day, she's a very lucky dog, three or four times a day,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.560]   we're out for a little walk, not too far, but just around the block. And we run into other dogs in
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.480]   the neighborhood. Obviously, there are a lot of people who have pet dogs that are doing the same
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.280]   thing that we are doing, walking their dogs. And there are some people in our neighborhood
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:28.960]   who just have, I feel, really poor dog etiquette. Like they won't have their dog on a leash. So the
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:38.960]   dog will be off leash. And that's annoying, because our dog is very calm and gentle. But the only time
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.800]   that she might bark is like if another dog just suddenly runs up and sort of surprises her.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:52.160]   So when there's an off leash dog, then I have to be on the guard and like be careful that my dog
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.280]   doesn't bark at this dog. And like, I don't know, I just feel like it's really rude, because it's
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.640]   putting this expectation that I suddenly have to take care of two dogs, just because you want to
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.520]   have this nice leisurely stroll with your dog. Like, you're not the king of the world, we have to
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.880]   share this park, we have to share this outdoor space. And everybody should keep their dog on a
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.440]   leash, even though they're just like little cute dogs. It's not really a big issue, but it's just
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:24.000]   the principle to me, like let's all follow the rules. And so that's one thing. And then another dog
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.400]   related thing is people who don't pick up their dog poop after their dog poops. It's insane to me.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   I can't believe that it exists. Like, how could you just feel like it's okay to
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.720]   leave a big mess in the middle of a walking path that thousands of people are walking on in the
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:51.280]   park every day? And you just look the other way and yeah, drives me crazy. Totally surprising that
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.880]   people do that. I know you wonder what's going through people's heads sometimes.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:02.400]   As a reactive dog owner, I could not agree more with you about the keeping your dog on a leash
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.840]   thing. I always have my dog on a leash because he is reactive. If a dog runs up to him or if he
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.920]   saw a dog, he might run up to him and bark at him or get aggressive or even a person. If they approach
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.520]   him really quickly, he gets scared and defensive, which is not good. But I'm a responsible dog owner,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.400]   I keep him on a tight leash. I'm very careful with him on walks. But exactly, I can't control
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:33.520]   your dog if your dog is off leash and has bad recall, which is just like a dog training term
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.040]   where you can get your dog to come back to you. When you say, "Hey, come back, come here," that's
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:45.280]   recall. If your dog has very poor recall skills, then why is that my problem? You're making it my
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.680]   problem. Then if my dog bites your dog, it was really your fault, but I would feel terrible.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:57.040]   Completely agree. Completely agree. Yeah, again, it's not like something that keeps me up at night,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.000]   right? And that expression to keep me up at night means it stresses you out to the extent
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.760]   where you can't sleep at night. It's so stressful. So it's not to that extent. I still sleep really
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.040]   well at night. However, it's something that I noticed and I'm like, "Ah, come on, come on."
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:19.760]   That's another thing that gets on my nerves. Anything else on your ends, Indiana?
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:27.040]   You know, I believe you don't have a car right now, but you're planning on it. Is that right?
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   You're going to get a car soon? Yeah, that's correct. Still in the thinking about it stage
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.360]   and have been for like a long time. Yes. I'm curious. Once you have your car,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.680]   you know, if you end up getting a car, choosing to get a car, I'd be very curious to know what you
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.760]   observe once you start driving and you see maybe some of the bad driving habits of other drivers
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.360]   and soul. Like in my city, I feel like there's a lot of really bad driving habits, a lot of bad
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:05.680]   drivers. And something that really bugs me is double parking on the road. So, of course,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:12.320]   on the sides of the roads, you can have a single file line of cars parked, pulled up to the curb.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:19.120]   But on certain roads, streets in my city, it's just so common for people to double park. So,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:25.520]   they create a second line of cars and put their emergency lights on and then run into a store for
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.560]   like five, ten minutes and come back out. But it's so annoying because it creates traffic jams and
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:36.640]   traffic issues. And if you're unlucky enough to have parked and then somebody's blocking you,
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.280]   you just have to, you have no choice but to wait for them to come back to their car so you can leave
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:48.400]   your spot. It's so annoying. It really grinds my gears, which is yet another expression for
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:58.800]   it gets on my nerves. It bugs me. Yeah, it grinds my gears. I think definitely so many people have
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.680]   things that get on their nerves about driving. Like this is maybe one of the most annoying things
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.560]   in life, like when you have to drive with other people. And I think the reason why this is is just
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.280]   because the consequences are so great, right? Like if there's an error when you're driving,
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:21.840]   it could result in a fatal, deadly accident. So like the consequences are very, very high for
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.760]   driving. And because of that, people are extra stressed out and then traffic jams or people
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.640]   driving poorly can just cause road rage, right? And yeah, I know for sure, this is actually one of
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.600]   the reasons why I've been a little bit on the fence about driving in Korea is because I've
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.760]   heard so many horror stories from friends about driving culture here. And I think it's just that
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.200]   there are so many cars on the roads and the roads are insane and people are trying to get to work
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.400]   quickly in the morning and come home quickly at night after work and are stressed out, right? So
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:03.600]   it just sounds like a really tense situation. And so because of that, definitely so many things get
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.200]   on on people's nerves. Thankfully, yeah, as of this moment, I'm not a driver. So I don't experience
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:16.960]   that. I do get similar stress when I'm walking or when I'm on my bicycle and people don't observe
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:24.240]   the rules about how to walk or how to ride a bike. But I think it's even stronger and more
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.280]   compounded when you're driving. Absolutely. To circle back, I'll just finish with my
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.920]   last thing that gets on my nerves here. And I probably could talk about this for hours and hours.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.560]   Indiana, I could probably keep thinking of things that are annoying. But I don't want to be like
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:45.040]   that person who constantly complain. So I'll just wrap it up with this. And I think people who are
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.160]   longtime Q lips listeners or regular Q lips listeners, guys, you can probably guess what this will be.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.000]   But it's to talk about phones. Again, Indiana, you mentioned at the start of the episode,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.720]   how you think it's so rude when you're hanging out with somebody and they're on their phone.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:06.640]   And maybe they're surfing the web or texting somebody and still kind of faking a conversation
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:14.480]   with you at the same time. I totally agree. That's really rude. But for me, I don't like it when
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:21.040]   people are using their phone in public in an inappropriate way. So maybe somebody's listening
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.480]   to music through their speaker instead of using headphones in like a cafe or on a bus or something.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:33.680]   Or when people are walking and using their phone, which I've talked about on Q lips before,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   I invented a nickname for these people. I call them phonies. Like they're kind of like these
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:46.240]   phone zombies, you know, but also like fake people like their phony. So the phonies out there who
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.840]   are just walking through life with their head down looking at their screen instead of interacting
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:58.080]   with the world around you. And then sometimes they bump into you. And then I guess also, you know,
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.760]   this is why I'm turning into an annoying person myself. I'm complaining about people who listen
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:10.160]   to music loudly through their phone speakers, but also the opposite people now who have the noise
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.720]   canceling headphones who just block out all of the sounds around them. And then they're oblivious
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.240]   to everything around them. And like, you know, I'm out running all the time, right? So I'm on the
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.880]   running path. And there are many other people out there running who have these noise canceling
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.920]   headphones in. And they can't hear when I'm coming up from behind them. So I have to like kind of
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.800]   pass them. And even if I say like, you know, I'm passing, they don't hear because I got the noise
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.440]   canceling headphones on. And then they're so shocked like, Oh, what are you doing? Come on.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.560]   What do you think you're like running very slowly and taking up the whole road and you've got the
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:52.240]   noise canceling headphones on? I don't know. The park is not your personal gym. So no, these kinds
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.080]   of things drive me crazy too. Oh, for sure. And it's just unsafe, you know, not only is it rude,
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.160]   but you know, that yeah, you should definitely as a rule, not use the noise canceling feature
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.560]   when you're when you're running or like, yeah, driving your car. Also, I see people with their
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.800]   ear ear pods in, in their car. Sometimes I'm like, wow, my God, wild, very dangerous.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:21.600]   It's very curious to me that there are some people out there who just live a much more dangerous
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:28.400]   life. It's like something I could never imagine doing. I've thought about getting some bells, like,
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.040]   like some little jingle bells and putting them on my ankle or something. So that when I'm running,
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.600]   I'm making this like jingle, jingle, jingle sound so that people can hear me coming. It's almost
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.560]   like a bike bell, right? But a pleasant reminder like, Hey, I'm coming up behind you. I don't want
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.600]   to scare you or anything. But now I think it wouldn't wouldn't be effective because of the noise
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.320]   canceling headphones that everyone has. Great technology. I love it. Don't get me wrong. But
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:59.600]   yeah, not safe for outside, I would say. Not at all. And also, you know, those bells might end up
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:06.560]   driving you crazy if you're on a really long run. I would need my own noise canceling headphones
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:13.120]   to block out the bell sound. Oh, yeah. Okay, well, Indiana, I think we should quit while we're ahead
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.760]   here. And I'm getting all worked up. I'm starting to get stressed out talking about all of these
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.880]   things that are getting on my nerves. I can feel my blood pressure rising. So I think we should
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:29.680]   call it quits here. So yeah, thanks for having this conversation with me. That was really fun.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.280]   And listeners, thanks for making it all the way to the end. You stuck in there, you completed an
