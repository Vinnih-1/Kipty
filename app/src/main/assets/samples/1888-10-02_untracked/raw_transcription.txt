[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The White Chappell Murderer Still Untracked
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   From the New York Times, October 2, 1888
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Recorded for LibraVox.org by Leanne Howlett
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   London's awful mystery, the White Chappell Murderer still untracked
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   from our own correspondent. London, October 1.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Excitement over the White Chappell Murderers has steadily increased during the day,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   the evening papers devoting all available space to the gory details.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   In the preceding cases, however, the murderer continues unknown and unsuspected.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   The Burner Street victim has been identified as Elizabeth Stride,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   alias Long Liz, a widow. The other is still unknown,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   but is believed to be a street walker known as May. Her face is so badly cut
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   that it is difficult to recognize her. The coroner has begun an inquest on the first woman.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   As before, in all these horrible crimes, the duty of investigation seems to devolve
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   on the coroner and the detectives sit at the inquest listening to the sworn testimony
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   to find out who did it. The whole police management of the cases,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   as indeed the system under which they work, is idiotic in the extreme.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Indignation meetings were held in several places in White Chappell today
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   to denounce Sir Charles Warren and Home Secretary Matthews.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   The daily telegraph this morning called loudly for Matthews's dismissal,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   since he had not since enough to resign. A petition to the Queen
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   is in preparation, asking her to offer a reward. Matthews, having stupidly
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   refused. The Lord Mayor promptly offered 500 pounds reward
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   this morning, the second murder having been committed within the precincts of the city.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   This, with other private rewards, makes a total of 1,200
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   pounds. There are any amount of theories published,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   some scientific, others ingenious, and others stupid. There are plenty
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   of clues also, but they are slight and show no signs of developing the murderer.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   The only trace considered of any value is the story of a watch boy,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   who saw a man and woman leave Aldgate station going towards Miter Square.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   The man returned shortly afterward alone. The police have a good description
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   of him. The daring character of the murders is evident from the fact that two people
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   at least saw a man and the woman together in the Burner Street gateway, and one saw him
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   throw her down. He went away and left her there, but it was half an hour before
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   it was known that she had been murdered. In the second case, a policeman swears
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   that he was not absent over 15 minutes from Miter Square, and must have been
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   watched by both man and woman as he went through, they following.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   The police confess tonight that they have no clues. A number of men have been arrested,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   but all were released. There is every prospect at present that these murders, like
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   their predecessors, will pass undetected. End of article.
