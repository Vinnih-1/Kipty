[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.720]   The tragedy at Harper's Ferry, the Liberator, October 28th, 1859, by William Lloyd Garrison,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:19.660]   recorded for LibriVox.org by ML Cohen Cleveland, Ohio March 2007.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.780]   We have devoted a large portion of our present number to the publication of such particulars
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.140]   of the well-intentioned but sadly misguided effort of Captain John Brown and his score of
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.140]   Confederates at Harper's Ferry to liberate the slaves in Virginia and ultimately throughout
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.740]   the South, as have been received.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.220]   With the comments of various democratic and republican journals upon this outbreak, which are
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.320]   characterized by an equal mixture of ferocity and cowardice.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.780]   As to the plot itself, it is evident that few or none were privy to it, except the
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.940]   little band directly engaged in it.
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.140]   For though Captain Brown had many to sympathize with him in different parts of the country.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.540]   In view of his terrible bereavement's perils and sufferings and cancers, in defense of the
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.100]   freedom of that territory against border-ruffy and invasion, and were disposed to contribute
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.060]   not only to relieve his necessities but also to facilitate the escape of slaves through his
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.260]   instrumentality to Canada.
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.500]   Still, an enterprise so wild and futile as this could not have received any countenance
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.140]   in that direction.
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.060]   As to Captain Brown, all who know him personally are united in the conviction that a more
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.100]   honest, conscientious, truthful, brave, disinterested man, prince, however misguided or unfortunate
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.540]   close prince, does not exist.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.140]   That he possesses a deeply religious nature, powerfully wrought upon by the trials through
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.940]   which he has passed, that he, as sincerely, believes himself to have been raised up by God
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.260]   to deliver the oppressed in this country, in the way he has chosen, as did Moses in relation
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.300]   to the deliverance of the captive Israelites.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.500]   That when he says he aims to be guided by the golden rule, it is no can't from his lips,
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.380]   but a vital application of it to his own soul.
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.460]   "Remembering those that are in bonds as bound with them," that when he affirms that
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.100]   he had no other motive for his conduct at Harper Ferry except to break the chains of the oppressed,
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.480]   by shedding of the least possible amount of human blood, he speaks, quote, "the truth,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.940]   the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," end quote.
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.620]   And that if he shall be, prince, as he will speedily beyond a per-adventure close prince,
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.460]   put to death, he will not die ignobly, but as a martyr to his sympathy for a suffering
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.620]   race, an in-defense of the sacred and inalienable rights of man, and will therefore
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.660]   deserve to be held in grateful and honorable remembrance to the latest posterity by all
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.620]   those who glory in the deeds of a Wallace or a tale, a Washington or a Warren.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.500]   Read his replies to interrogatory's propounded to him by senator Mason and others.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.780]   Is there another man of all the thirty millions of people inhabiting this country who could
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.500]   have answered more wisely, more impressively, more courageously, or with greater moral dignity
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.140]   under such a trying ordeal?
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.340]   How many hearts will be thrilled and inspired by his utterances?
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.780]   Read, too, his replies in court with reference to his counsel, "We are sure a more
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.140]   undaunted spirit be found."
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.900]   In vain will the sanguinary tyrants of the South, and their northern minions seek to
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.000]   cover him with infamy.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.620]   For, by the logic of Concord Lexington and Bunker Hill, and by the principles enforced
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.540]   by this nation in its boasted declaration of independence, Captain Brown was a hero, struggling
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.540]   against fearful odds, not for his own advantage, but to redeem others from a horrible
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.940]   bondage, to be justified in all that he aimed to achieve, however lacking in sound discretion.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.580]   And by the same logic, in the same principles, every slaveholder has forfeited his right
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.060]   to live if his destruction be necessary to enable his victims to break the yoke of bondage.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.860]   And they, and all who are disposed to aid them by force and arms, are fully warranted in
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.420]   carrying rebellion to any extent and securing freedom at whatever cost.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.420]   It will be a terribly losing day for all slaveholders when John Brown and his associates
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.060]   are brought to the gallows.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.820]   It will be sowing seed broadcast for a harvest of retribution.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.500]   Their blood will cry trumpet-tongued from the ground, and that cry will be responded to by
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.140]   tens of thousands in a manner that shall cause the knees of the southern slave-mongers
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.580]   to smite together as did those a bell-shazzer of old.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:05.300]   Oh, that they might avoid all this by a timely repentance.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.340]   End of article.
