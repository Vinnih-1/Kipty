[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100]   Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Simplified Speech.
[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.320]   Simplified Speech is the Q-LIP series,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.880]   which features clear, natural, and easy to understand
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.320]   conversations between native speakers.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.480]   Today, joining me for this episode is Indiana.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.460]   Hello, Indiana, how are you doing?
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.320]   - Yeah, I'm doing good, Andrew.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.960]   And I'm also really excited for our topic today.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.040]   That is that we're going to be talking about
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   chemicals or harmful substances that we try to avoid
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760]   in our day-to-day lives, like household cleaners
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.520]   or beauty products or things like that.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.160]   This was actually requested by a listener,
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.880]   a member of Q-LIPs.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.000]   And yeah, I think it'll be a really interesting conversation.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.600]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.760]   So shout out to Adityka, one of our very active Q-LIPs members
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.880]   over on our Discord channel who've left us
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.000]   this episode topic suggestion and said,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.600]   "Hey guys, can you talk about this?"
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.800]   Because Adityka is from Hungary, I believe,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.560]   and she mentioned that there weren't too many conversations
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.000]   about this topic that she could find in her native language.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.280]   And so if she wants to learn more about it,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.640]   she has to listen to content in English
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.280]   and talking about chemicals and substances and detergents
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.720]   and cleaners, this is pretty difficult.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.120]   So we're gonna do our best to have a simple conversation
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.040]   about it because this is simplified speech.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.080]   So as we go through the conversation,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.720]   Indiana and I will stop and break down
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.040]   and explain difficult expressions and vocabulary
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.480]   that we use when we're talking about this topic.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.240]   So we'll hold your hand through this one, guys,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.880]   and we'll walk you through it.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.520]   And yeah, we're gonna talk about just some of the ways
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.080]   that we try to stay chemical-free in our lives.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.520]   Maybe that's a good way to put it.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.960]   So we'll get started with our conversation here
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.360]   in just a moment, but before we do,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.000]   I wanna let you know about the helpful study guide
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.760]   and the interactive transcripts that is available
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.640]   for this episode for all Q-Lips members.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.680]   As inside the guide, you will find detailed,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.840]   vocabulary explanations and examples
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.000]   of all of the key and important vocabulary
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.040]   that you'll hear Indiana and me mention today.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.920]   There's also a comprehension quiz,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.280]   so you can test how much you are able to understand.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.440]   And there are questions that you can use
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.360]   for writing practice or for speaking practice.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.080]   And of course, it's so good and so important
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.480]   to be active with your English as well,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.360]   not only doing the listening side,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.400]   but being active and producing the language.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.640]   So those prompts can help you.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.880]   And of course, we'll also have a speaking class
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.600]   for several speaking classes about this topic.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   So you'll be able to speak with the Q-Lips teachers
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.880]   and with other members who are very highly motivated
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.600]   English learners, just like yourself.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.080]   So if you would like to get all of these benefits
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.640]   and bonuses, plus so many more,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.840]   then check out our website qlips.com

[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.000]   for an affordable price.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.480]   Okay, so Indiana, with that announcement out of the way,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.920]   let's get started with our topic today,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.640]   which is avoiding chemicals
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.720]   and trying to keep our bodies and our lives
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.320]   chemical-free and safe and healthy.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   And so, you know, I haven't really thought
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.680]   about this topic too much before Aditycup brought it up,
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.200]   but I know that you are maybe more invested in it than I am.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.480]   So why don't we start with you?
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.120]   I'll let you to the heavy lifting for this episode
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.480]   and I'll chime in when I can.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.800]   But why don't you tell us about some of the things
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   that you do in your life,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   just to avoid using chemicals or avoid using products
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.320]   that you believe or maybe you feel that could be harmful?
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.600]   And when we say harmful here, you know,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.120]   I'm thinking of like chemical detergents or cleaners
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.200]   or these things that you just get a bad vibe about, right?
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.720]   Like you look at the bottle and you see warnings
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.240]   and maybe you see like a poisonous warning label
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.200]   with like the skull and you're like,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.000]   okay, this is like a toxic thing.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.840]   Like I don't want to breathe this in.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.000]   Maybe if you smell it, you almost instantly get a headache.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.480]   You're like, okay, yeah, this is obviously not a healthy product.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.360]   I don't want to use this too much.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.840]   I'm thinking about avoiding those kind of heavy cleaners
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.680]   and stuff.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.560]   Are there any things that you do in your life
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.880]   to avoid using those kinds of products?
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.360]   Yeah, and I want to backtrack and start this conversation
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.440]   on this topic with a sort of cautionary note
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.240]   or something that I think can be misleading
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.200]   with this word chemical.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.800]   Like chemicals are not inherently bad
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.200]   and everything around us is chemicals.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.560]   Like I think chemicals is just any sort of compound
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.000]   that you would could talk about in a chemistry class,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.480]   like table salt.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.240]   Sodium chloride, right?
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.360]   And that's not poisonous or harmful necessarily.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.240]   And I think another thing that I want everybody
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.480]   when they're thinking about this topic to consider
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.920]   is that in large doses,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.720]   anything could really be fatal or toxic, right?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.640]   Like if you drink too much water,
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.200]   you could die from that, right?
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.840]   So there's, I think from with that thought, first of all,
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.120]   at the beginning of this conversation,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.120]   not every chemical is bad.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.160]   And many things are not harmful in small doses,
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.720]   but very harmful in larger doses.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.960]   I think that's a good place to start to consider
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.240]   like, yeah, what do I want to have in my home
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.000]   and what do I want to use?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.080]   Is it okay if I use this every single day?
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   I think like what I consider when I'm thinking about my health
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.560]   or, you know, yeah, what could be harming me
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.440]   is volatile compounds,
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.680]   volatile organic compounds, which is a term basically
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.320]   for a chemical that gets released into the air
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.840]   and can harm you.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.200]   So for example, a really common item
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.440]   that would count as that a volatile organic compound
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   would be bleach, household bleach, right?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.960]   That's a cleaner that is probably in everybody's house.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.000]   And like you mentioned, you know, you open up that bottle
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.520]   and you instantly get a headache from smelling it.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.680]   Like that's definitely not a safe thing
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.680]   to be using regularly or without air flow ventilation.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.120]   So I think the first thing I always try to consider
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.680]   is like air flow ventilation
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.000]   and how frequently am I using this product?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.960]   Yeah, so it's just one simple thing.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.400]   I try to avoid using bleach unless I really have to use it.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.800]   And if I use it, I try to make sure that the windows
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.280]   or the doors to that room are open
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.720]   and there's good air flow.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.200]   Maybe I even wear a mask.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.320]   I think that is definitely one simple step
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.880]   somebody could take to try to reduce any negative effects
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.960]   from a household cleaner like that.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   Okay, so windows open, mask on, maybe some gloves.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.440]   Gloves, great point.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.720]   Yes.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.160]   Okay, so avoiding using bleach.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.440]   I have to say, yeah, I don't think I've used bleach
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.280]   in a long, long time.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.120]   But it depends on the situation.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.560]   Like if I had a situation where I needed to do
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.480]   some really heavy duty cleaning and use bleach,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.960]   then probably I would use it.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.320]   Like I'm not against using these things, really.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.160]   I know when I lived in my previous apartment,
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.400]   we had an issue with the drain being clogged.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.080]   And I bought some drain cleaner at that time
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.760]   to try and unclog.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.600]   I don't know.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.400]   There was like a hairball down there or something.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.640]   So I had to like bust the clog.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.200]   And yeah, that was like a really nasty chemical.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.080]   And I felt really guilty actually about using it
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.920]   because you're pouring this down the drain
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.160]   and it's going into who knows where the water supply
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.760]   is somewhere down the line and you're always worried,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.480]   like, is this going to kill some fish
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.400]   or kill some little animals that are like living
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.640]   in that ecosystem?
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.120]   Like I don't know where the water goes when it goes
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.560]   into the drain, but I imagine somewhere it comes out
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.920]   like into a stream or into a river
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.520]   and maybe that's incorrect.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.560]   It probably gets filtered or something first.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.880]   But yeah, I still felt really guilty about using that
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.440]   because I'm worried about the downstream effect
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.880]   and that expression, guys, the downstream effect
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.480]   means what will happen later?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.720]   What will happen next as that chemical
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.840]   makes its way through the water supply?
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.920]   So I was worried about that.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.960]   And then also for my own personal health as well,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.360]   that seems like a really, really nasty, dangerous product.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.200]   Like if I were to smell it too long
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.000]   or if I were to drink it or something, I would die.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.520]   So I didn't like using that, but yeah,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.720]   there was no other way that I could think of
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.800]   to unclog the drain.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.480]   I tried all the other things first.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.960]   And when it comes to cleaning my home and stuff as well,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.800]   I think I tried to have just gentle cleaners,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   nothing too heavy duty and trying to do cleaning every day
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.080]   instead of leaving things to build up
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.840]   because if things really build up and get super dirty
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.800]   and then you do need to clean them,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   then that's when you're gonna need to use those
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.680]   like heavy duty cleaners, right?
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.160]   And that could be more toxic or more dangerous.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.480]   So like every time I use the microwave or something,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.040]   I'll just give it a little wipe when I'm finished
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.560]   so that it doesn't build up and get super nasty.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.720]   I think maybe that's one strategy that I use.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.880]   - That's a really good strategy.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.000]   Yeah, I think that's great advice generally.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.040]   Yeah, you can avoid a lot of the, like you said,
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.960]   heavy duty, great expression for that.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.960]   So heavy duty means that something is working 110%.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.480]   And so it probably has some pretty powerful stuff in it
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.280]   that will, for example, get rid of the grease
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.720]   on your stove top or something like that,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.080]   like caked on to your stove top, right?
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.280]   So you need a heavy duty product to get through
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.000]   that grime and dirt sometimes.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.040]   - Yeah, heavy duty.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.160]   And we also use this to describe things
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   that are very sturdy or very solid or very well built, right?
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.880]   Like a heavy duty pickup truck, right?
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.440]   Like you think about this pickup truck
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.680]   that's like really, really well made and sturdy
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.400]   and it's not gonna break down that kind of thing, heavy duty.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.680]   Okay, so Indiana, I know that you do a lot of little things
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.040]   in your life just to maybe not necessarily
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.200]   to avoid chemicals, but just to be more natural, right?
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.600]   To keep it natural and clean and fresh.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.440]   So what are those things that you do?
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.760]   Could you tell us about some of them?
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.000]   - I think it's true that there are some
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   unregulated ingredients or poorly regulated ingredients
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.120]   that are in a lot of beauty products
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.400]   and household cleaners and things like that.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.000]   That it's not really clear how dangerous they might be,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.440]   but if you're interested in health
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.640]   and being on the safe side with these kinds of things,
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.520]   like I tend to be that kind of person.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.960]   I don't go really crazy with it or obsess over it,
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.320]   but when I can, I try to pick something
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.640]   that I have researched a little bit
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.400]   or seems a little bit, a little bit safer or healthier.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.720]   So one thing that I do is I try to avoid products
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   that have the word fragrance on the ingredient list.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.080]   fragrance refers to whatever the scent or aroma
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.400]   that is in that product is,
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.440]   but it's a term that could be like hundreds
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.720]   of different possible chemical compounds.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.120]   And those are not necessarily regulated
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.880]   and it's not clear which one is being used in the product.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.000]   So because there's just not that clarity
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.920]   or that access to the information,
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.240]   like which fragrance is used in this cleaning product
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.520]   or this beauty product,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.000]   I try to avoid that as an ingredient altogether.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.120]   So yeah, picking something that does not have fragrance
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.040]   on the ingredient list, that would be another suggestion
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.280]   if you're interested in this, that you could try.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.800]   Another reason for that though too,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.600]   is that I've just a very sensitive nose,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.520]   very sensitive to strong smells.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.920]   And yeah, it's just easier to avoid that
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.640]   for that reason as well.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.880]   I don't know how you feel about strongly scented,
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.160]   strongly perfumed cleaning products,
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.240]   but yeah, they really bother me.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   - Yeah, I'm not a fan either.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.360]   I try to avoid it as well.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.240]   And Indiana, I just wanna take a step back
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.360]   for a minute to talk about those two expressions
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.680]   that you just introduced, regulated and unregulated.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.680]   So when we're talking about regulations,
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.200]   that's the noun form, something is regulated.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.000]   It means the government has a law or a standard
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.880]   that companies must follow to make sure
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.760]   that something is safe, right?
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.200]   Something is safe.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.760]   And unregulated means there is no law or no standards
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.480]   and you can just do whatever you want.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.640]   So yeah, when it comes to the ingredient list,
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.560]   when you look at the back of a beauty product
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.000]   or you look at the back of a cleaner,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.120]   or even some food products as well,
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.400]   sometimes we see like these very, very vague ingredients,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.280]   like it will say fragrance.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.880]   Like what does that mean, fragrance?
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.440]   I know fragrance is related to a smell,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.560]   like a positive, nice smell,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.640]   but like what exactly is that?
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.280]   And how are you making that fragrance?
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.720]   Or if you look at the back of some food products,
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.480]   like some heavily processed,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.360]   kind of artificial unnatural food,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.240]   sometimes it will say something like color, like food color.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.720]   And you're like, okay, what is that?
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.760]   What is food color, like, or red?
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.000]   It will say red color.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.480]   You're like, okay, but what does that mean?
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.520]   Like that's not a food.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.480]   I can't grow red color in my garden.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.680]   So it's something that's not natural.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.560]   So yeah, those very, very vague ingredients,
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.960]   sometimes can be red flags, right?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.200]   They can be warnings that perhaps this is not so good
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.040]   for our health.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.840]   So yeah, that's a great point.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   And I know personally, now I kind of came to this accidentally.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.280]   I didn't really intend to do this,
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.600]   but when it comes to deodorant,
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.160]   I live here in Seoul, South Korea, as listeners know.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.840]   And for whatever reason,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.880]   it's not very common to wear deodorant in Korea.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.040]   And so I remember when I moved here for the first time,
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.880]   I grew up wearing deodorant and then I came here
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.480]   and I looked in the toiletry aisle in the market
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.720]   and I couldn't find any.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.280]   And I realized this is a thing that Koreans,
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.360]   for the most part, don't wear deodorant.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.960]   However, that was a problem for me
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.920]   because I kind of need it.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.680]   And I want to stay fresh and clean.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.840]   And so I was like, oh my God, what can I do here?
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.440]   Koreans don't wear deodorant, but I'm used to wearing it.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.280]   And it's important for my hygiene to wear this.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.840]   And so I looked into some alternatives and I went online
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.920]   and I think I found some like some hippie websites
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.160]   because you know, we have this expression in English,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.960]   like hippie, hippie is very loaded.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.680]   It can mean a lot of different things.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.720]   But when we're talking about like natural products,
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.440]   we think of a hippie as somebody
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.600]   that's like really trying their best
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.800]   to avoid using anything that's unnatural
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.920]   and really using a lot of like homemade products
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.480]   and products that are clean and safe and healthy.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.600]   And so I found like some hippie websites
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.680]   and they were talking about making your own homemade deodorant
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.520]   using coconut oil and baking soda
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.880]   and I think even some lemon juice you can use
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.240]   to get like a little lemon, like light lemon scent.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.120]   And so I was like, I'm gonna try it.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.800]   And it turned out like working perfectly
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.080]   and I still even use it to this day.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.120]   This is like 10 years later.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.880]   It's a little bit harder to maintain
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.680]   because you have to keep it in the fridge or the freezer
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.320]   so that the coconut oil doesn't melt.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.080]   But other than that, it like is very effective
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.440]   and I feel like it's a lot safer
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.880]   than the store-bought deodorant,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.680]   which you know, has a lot of chemicals inside of it
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.440]   and it has aluminum inside of it.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.600]   And I have Alzheimer's that runs in my family,
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.360]   both on my mother's side and my father's side.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.760]   And I've heard that Alzheimer's is somehow linked
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.960]   to aluminum or there could be a link
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.720]   between aluminum and Alzheimer's.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.840]   So I think it's probably best if I keep that
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.200]   out of my system and I don't let it enter my body.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.800]   So that's like one little thing that I did
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   but yeah, it wasn't intentional.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.840]   It wasn't like, I gotta stay safe.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.160]   I gotta stop using deodorant.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.280]   It's just like, was born out of necessity
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.600]   because I had no other options.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.720]   Are there any things like that that you do?
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.160]   Maybe like some homemade concoction,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.800]   something that you make yourself
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.840]   to avoid using some other product?
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.920]   - That's interesting.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   You know, sometimes to clean my microwave,
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.320]   like you mentioned that earlier,
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.360]   I squeeze some lemon juice in a bowl with water
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.520]   and I just like blast that in the microwave,
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.160]   put it on high heat for a few minutes
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.560]   and the steam kind of with the lemon spreads
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.400]   throughout the microwave
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.880]   and then you can easily wipe down whatever grime
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.520]   or food stands, things, dirt that's in there.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.120]   That's a good way, yeah.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.360]   But I don't know that I make so many homemade things
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.040]   like that, homemade beauty products or cleaning products.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.080]   I don't think so.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.320]   But the aluminum and deodorant thing
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.960]   is definitely something that is talked about a lot
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.480]   and I'm not even clear on how much evidence there is
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.200]   for whether it causes problems.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.240]   I've also heard of it being linked to breast cancer.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.040]   But yeah, that's definitely a common one that you hear about.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.680]   I really don't know if there have been more recent studies
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.960]   or new information about that,
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.040]   but yeah, you hear about these links and these things
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.920]   that could be a problem for your health
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.800]   and it can get really scary
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.400]   when you think everything around me could be harming me, right?
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.160]   So I also wanna want to stress that like, you know,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.360]   I agree, it's better to be safe than sorry
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.040]   and I try to avoid chemicals
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.880]   that I've heard might cause cancer and things like that.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.000]   But you know, you can't avoid everything
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.240]   and you're gonna have to interact with some of these products
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.680]   and I hope that listeners don't get too stressed about this
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.040]   because it's a great idea to avoid some of these things
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.680]   when you can, but there are these things,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.720]   these forever chemicals or these microplastics
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.120]   that you hear about PFAs or PFAS.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.640]   Sometimes people call them PFAS
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.440]   and they're just like everywhere.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.040]   They're all over our water supply.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.680]   They're in our bodies and they're probably bad for us,
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.720]   but you know, we can't really avoid them.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.680]   They're in every product that we use basically.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.920]   So at some point, I think you also just have to
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.520]   raise up your hands and say, okay, I'm doing my best,
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.560]   but I'm not gonna stress about this every day
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.360]   and you know, every waking moment.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.240]   I don't know.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.240]   It's really hard 'cause I really do agree
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.640]   and I wanna avoid these dangerous things.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.920]   But I also like, you know, I know it's good.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.680]   It might actually be more harmful
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.480]   if I'm thinking about this every day
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.320]   and you know, and all of my free time, right?
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.080]   - Yeah, it's so like annoying, isn't it?
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.600]   I find it annoying because you wanna live a healthy life
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.440]   and it's so difficult.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.080]   Like, why does it have to be so difficult?
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.840]   Why do I have to consider each and every product?
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.000]   Like, why can't companies just make things that are healthy?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.560]   And even when it comes to food,
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:32.360]   because I think for me, the best way to stay healthy
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.840]   is eating pure, natural, unprocessed foods, right?
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.320]   So like, yeah, eating heavily processed foods
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.120]   is definitely a way that we're gonna get sick
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.600]   or maybe develop cancer or something like this.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:51.160]   So I try and eat as much unprocessed natural food as I can,
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.000]   but then you're like, okay, I went to the grocery store
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   and I bought some vegetables.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.200]   But then are they pesticide-free?
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.880]   Are they organic?
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.800]   Are they natural?
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.000]   Like, is even eating this carrot gonna cause me some problems
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.440]   because of the way that this carrot was grown?
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.560]   So it's just like, you can really, really go down
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.480]   the rabbit hole and it is like annoying
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.320]   that we have to be so cautious and so careful
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:18.520]   about each step of the consumption process.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.000]   So unfortunately, Indiana, like you said,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.320]   we have to wave the white flag and surrender
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.440]   because we can't really control every little element
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.520]   of the things that enter our lives.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.240]   - Right, that's true.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.720]   But, you know, I keep flip-flopping here, right?
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.840]   'Cause I really do think about this sometimes
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.640]   and I try to be careful with what I use.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.640]   So to return to our listener and member Adityka's
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.920]   original question, right?
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.320]   What are some things that you do to avoid harmful chemicals
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.440]   or things that are bad for you in the house
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.600]   with household cleaners and things like that?
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.480]   Well, something that I do, which is simple
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.760]   that I think, you know, a lot of people could do,
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.320]   if you are somebody who burns candles
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.440]   because you love a scented candle,
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.440]   makes your house smell good and it relaxes you.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.480]   Instead of burning a candle, which, of course,
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.000]   you have a flame in your house and that's producing smoke
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.800]   and that's not very good for you,
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.960]   let alone any fragrances that you can look into
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.520]   or research independently in that candle, you know,
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.000]   try to get a candle that has some fragrances
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.640]   that you're confident about.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.220]   But instead of burning it, you could get a candle warmer,
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.160]   which is a product that it's basically like a little heat lamp
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   so it heats up the candle so that the wax melts
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.160]   but it's not on fire, it's not producing a flame.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.880]   So you can still enjoy the smell,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.240]   it makes the candle last way longer
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.640]   and then you don't have an open flame
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.120]   in your house creating smoke.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.680]   So, you know, if you have a pretty small apartment,
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.240]   smoke could really do some damage to not only your health
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.480]   but like the walls and your furniture.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.480]   So, that's something to consider.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.320]   One other thing that I am pretty serious about
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.400]   is I do not microwave my food and plastic.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.840]   There is a chemical that can be found in many plastics
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.640]   called phthalates, now that has a pretty weird spelling.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.640]   P-H-T-H-A-L-A-T-E-S phthalates.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.480]   Now, I'm not a scientist, right?
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.960]   But I'm pretty confident from what I've read
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.360]   that phthalates when you heat them up
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.160]   in the plastic that they're a part of,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.480]   they can kind of release from that plastic
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.960]   and move into something else like the food
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.400]   that's in that container.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.880]   And they can definitely, I've seen,
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.560]   I've read that they could be linked to cancer
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.000]   and other problems like that.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.080]   So, because we don't know what is in our plastic
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.560]   all the time, right?
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.640]   I think it's just a lot safer to microwave food
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.560]   in glass or maybe on a ceramic plate or something like that.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.240]   So I will never microwave my food and plastic
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   because it's like so much work to try to figure out
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.320]   what kind of plastic the container is
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.000]   and that's just an easier, better safe than sorry thing
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.600]   for me that I don't have to stress about, right?
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.960]   That's like a very simple choice
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.040]   that I'm not gonna be thinking about every day
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.080]   and stressing about.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.760]   So yeah, I microwave my food and glass
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.480]   and I use a candle warmer instead of burning my candles.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.840]   So those are two things that I do, yeah.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.920]   - Nice, I'm not really a candle guy.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.880]   I don't burn any candles,
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.520]   but if I were to burn candles, that's a great tip.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.840]   And I'm totally with you on the microwaving plastic as well.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.080]   I kind of feel like growing up,
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.680]   that was just a thing that everybody was taught back
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.600]   in Canada is don't microwave plastic.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.840]   I'm not sure, maybe it was like that in the States as well,
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.280]   but that's something that I've carried forward.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.080]   And with me, my whole life is I'll never microwave plastic.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.680]   And this is another thing, I think, just growing up,
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.880]   when I was growing up,
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.400]   that I guess like in the late '80s, early '90s,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.600]   there were still a lot of people that said microwaves
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.040]   were unsafe and that you could get cancer
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.640]   from using the microwave.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.140]   So I think that caused a little bit of trauma.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.920]   So I do use the microwave.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.360]   I'm not like an anti-microwave guy.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.560]   However, if I have an option,
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.800]   just between throwing some leftovers in a frying pan
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.680]   or popping them in the microwave,
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.400]   I'll almost always just put it in a frying pan
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.640]   and heat it up that way.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.000]   I think that might be a little bit of that microwave trauma
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.280]   from the propaganda,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.480]   the anti-microwave propaganda when I was growing up.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.240]   And yeah, even some things with frying pans as well,
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.880]   like you have to be careful about the cookware you use.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.520]   In an ideal world, I would use cast iron.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.920]   I used to use cast iron before I got married,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.640]   but now in my new home, I have this like induction oven.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.920]   So I can't use cast iron with it.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.520]   So I have to use like these special frying pans
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.440]   that work with the induction stovetop.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.000]   And yeah, I'm very careful with those as well.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Like I always make sure that I use some kind of cooking tool
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.320]   that won't scratch the frying pan
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.720]   because I'm worried that the like the coating on the frying pan
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.400]   could maybe get into my food and then make me sick somehow.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   So I'm a little careful about that.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.960]   Also, Adityka in her request, she mentioned talking about water
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.760]   and do you drink water from plastic bottles
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.040]   or how do you get your drinking water?
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.640]   And I'm lucky enough that I have like a filtration system
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.480]   in my home.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   So the water that I drink is always filtered before
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.280]   it comes out of the tap.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.160]   How about you, Indiana?
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.320]   What do you do for drinking water?
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.840]   - Oh, yeah, that's a great question.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.880]   And that is something that is worth looking into
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.760]   depending on where you live.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.200]   When my husband and I bought our house
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.280]   as part of our home inspection,
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.200]   the inspectors found that there was a lead water main.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.320]   So the connection to the city's water
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.720]   and the pipes that carry the water
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.160]   that we use for drinking and using the bathroom
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.680]   into our house, the connector was made of lead.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   So obviously that is not safe at all.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.360]   So we had to get that replaced
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.360]   and there has been historically an issue with lead
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.760]   in the water pipes in my city and in surrounding cities.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.600]   So yeah, this is of course totally regional,
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.240]   but that's something to consider
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.200]   like how safe is your drinking water
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.520]   and is it worth it to try to use a filter
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.960]   or something like that?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.320]   Since there's no lead in my water anymore, right?
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.160]   'Cause we replaced it.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.040]   I'm not so concerned about filtering my water,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.400]   but yeah, I think that's another easy thing.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.440]   If you have evidence or reason to believe
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.720]   that your water, your drinking water is not so good,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.080]   it should be pretty easy to find
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.560]   like an activated charcoal filter in a water bottle
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.400]   or something like that.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.240]   I'm pretty sure those get rid of a lot
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.320]   of problematic ingredients.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.920]   Ingredients, that's probably the wrong word.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.200]   (laughs)
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.680]   Things that are floating around in your water, yeah.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.800]   (laughs)
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.640]   Yes.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.480]   Yeah, yeah, good point.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.440]   And like I said earlier,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.080]   I think it's just so frustrating
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.120]   that we have to go to all of these lengths.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.400]   Like we're busy enough, we're stressed out enough
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.600]   in our daily lives and now we have to worry about
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.720]   the pipes that our water is transported through
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.200]   into our home, right?
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.520]   Like here in Seoul, the water is actually very safe to drink.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.200]   It's totally fine to drink tap water
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.800]   and I used to drink tap water for many years
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   before getting married and then my wife was like,
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.320]   "What are you doing drinking tap water?
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.520]   Are you crazy?"
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.560]   And I was like, "It's fine, I'm totally fine.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.000]   It's clean, it's okay."
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.080]   But then she was like,
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.000]   "Yeah, the water might be okay
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.160]   when it comes out of the processing plant,
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.360]   but then it's going through all of these old pipes."
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.000]   And like, "How are you sure that the pipes are safe
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.520]   and the pipes are clean?"
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.080]   And then I was like, "Yeah, that's probably a good point,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   I'm not sure."
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.640]   And I know a lot of Korean people don't trust
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.880]   the drinking water, they say it's not so good,
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.160]   but yeah, the government says it's fine.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.840]   I never had a problem with it, doesn't smell,
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.480]   tastes totally fine.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.000]   So yeah, it's kind of annoying that something as basic
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.720]   as drinking water is something that we have to be
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.440]   concerned about, but hey, that's reality,
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.440]   that's the world that we live in
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.880]   and everybody can make their own choice for themselves
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.440]   about that.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.800]   Anyways, Indiana, I think we've said a lot about this topic
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.920]   and I hope that you found it useful and educational
