[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.300]   "The Parnell Inquiry and Another Butchery" from The New York Times, November 10, 1888,
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.340]   recorded for Libervox.org by Leanne Howlett.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.560]   Exciting London events, "The Parnell Inquiry and Another Butchery" by Commercial Cable
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.680]   from Our Own Correspondent, London November 9.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.840]   From today's proceedings of the Parnell Commission, it seems likely that the inquiry here after
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.080]   it will go on in a cloud of sparks knocked out by partisan conflict.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.160]   The Irish members are deeply indignant at the persistent pro-times rulings of Justice
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.280]   Hannon and only less vexed with their English lawyers who have so tamely accepted these
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.720]   rulings without protest.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.000]   The mutterings against this subpoenas have finally grown so loud that Sir Charles Russell
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.360]   was today impaled to try a sharp fall with Justice Hannon.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.560]   The incident was exciting at the time, but it is most interesting as presaging a partisan
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.120]   struggle from this out with the great probability of somebody going to prison for contempt of
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120]   court.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.600]   The most eligible candidate for this distinction appears at present to be William O'Brien,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.520]   who this week attacks the Commission in United Ireland as a one-sided fraud.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.640]   The discovery today of the seventh white chapel murder, this time believed to have been committed
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.680]   in broad daylight and involving the most terrible wholesale mutilation it is possible to imagine
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.600]   overshadows all other topics in the London mind tonight.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.080]   Bloodhounds are out, but I am unable to learn at this hour that they have discovered anything.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.800]   The conclusion is now universal that the assassin is a periodic lunatic who, unless detected
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.000]   at once, is likely to commit a fresh series of crimes within a few days before his frenzy
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   passes away.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.080]   Also, London, November 9.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.800]   At eleven o'clock this morning, the body of a woman cut into pieces was discovered in
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.840]   a house on Dorset Street's spittle fields.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.880]   The police are endeavoring to track the murderer with the aid of bloodhounds.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.320]   The appearance of the body was frightful and the mutilation was even greater than in the
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.080]   previous cases.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.840]   The head had been severed and placed beneath one of the arms.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.240]   The ears and nose had been cut off.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.680]   The body had been disemboweled and the flesh was torn from the thighs.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.360]   Some of the organs were missing.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.800]   The skin had been torn off the forehead and cheeks.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.600]   One hand had been pushed into the stomach.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.320]   The victim, like all the others, was disreputable.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.720]   She was married and her husband was a porter.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.280]   They lived together at spasmodic intervals.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.440]   Her name is believed to have been Lizzy Fisher, but to most of the obituaries of the haunts
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.280]   she visited she was known as Mary Jane.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.000]   She had a room in the house where she was murdered.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.880]   She carried a latch key and no one knows at what hour she entered the house last night
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.520]   and probably no one saw the man who accompanied her.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.120]   Therefore it is hardly likely that he will ever be identified.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.840]   He might easily have left the house at any time between one and six o'clock this morning
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.960]   without attracting attention.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.760]   The doctors who have examined the body refused to make any statement until the inquest is
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.320]   held.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.200]   Three blood hounds belonging to private citizens were taken to the place and put on the scent
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.840]   of the murderer, but they were unable to keep it for any great distance and all hope of
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.960]   running the assassin down with their assistance will have to be abandoned.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.720]   The murdered woman told a companion last evening that she was without money and would commit
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.840]   suicide if she did not obtain a supply.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.520]   It has been learned that a man, respectively dressed, accosted the victim and offered her
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   money.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.260]   They went to her lodgings on the second floor of the Dorset Street House.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.960]   No noise was heard during the night and nothing was known of the murder until the landlady
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.360]   went to the room early this morning to ask for her rent.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840]   The first thing she saw in entering the room were the woman's breasts and viscera lying
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.760]   on a table.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.840]   Dorset Street is short and narrow and is situated close to Miter Square and Hanbury Street.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.200]   In the House of Commons today Mr. Kona Bear asked the question whether if it was true that
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   another woman had been murdered in London, General Warren, the Chief of the Metropolitan
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.120]   Police, ought not to be superseded by an officer accustomed to investigate crime.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.080]   The question was greeted by cries of, "Oh, oh."
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.800]   The speaker called, "Order, order," and said that notice must be given of the question
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.360]   in the usual way.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.320]   Mr. Kona Bear replied, "I have given private notice."
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.680]   The speaker, the notice must be made in writing.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.480]   Mr. Cunningham Graham then asked whether General Warren had already resigned to which Mr. Smith,
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.440]   the government leader, replied no.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.760]   End of article.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.640]   This recording is in the public domain.
