[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.700]   LibraVox.org by Leanne Howlett. Something About Dr. Tumblety. San Francisco, November
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.960]   22. Chief of Police Crowley has lately been in correspondence with officials of Scotland
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.400]   Yard, London regarding Dr. Tumblety, who is at present under arrest on suspicion of
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.480]   being implicated in the White Chapel murders. The chief, in pursuing his investigations,
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.300]   discovered that the doctor still had quite a balance in the Hyburnia Bank, which he left
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.600]   there when he disappeared from this city and which has never been drawn upon.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.400]   Mr. Smythe of that institution says that he first met the doctor in Toronto, where he
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.000]   was practicing medicine in July 1858. He next met him in this city at the Occidental
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.200]   Hotel in March or April 1870. Tumblety rented an office at 20 Montgomery Street, where
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.360]   he remained until September 1870 and then disappeared as suddenly as he came. In 1871,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.800]   the doctor turned up in New York. On October 29, Chief Crowley sent a dispatch to the London
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.920]   detectives, informing them that he could furnish specimens of Tumblety's handwriting, and
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.840]   today he received an answer to send the papers at once. End of article. This recording is
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.000]   in the public domain.
