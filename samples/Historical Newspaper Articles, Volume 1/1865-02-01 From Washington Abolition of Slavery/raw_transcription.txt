[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   From Washington, Abolition of Slavery. From the New York Times, February 1st, 1865.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Read for LibraVox.org by Betsy Bush.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Passage of the Constitutional Amendment. 119 yays against 56 nays.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Exciting scene in the House. Enthusiasm over the result.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Washington, Tuesday, January 31st.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   The Passage of the Constitutional Amendment.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   The great feature of the existing rebellion was the passage today
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   by the House of Representatives of the Resolutions
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   submitting to the legislatures of the several states
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   It was an epoch in the history of the country
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   and will be remembered by the members of the House and spectators present
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   as an event in their lives.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   At three o'clock by general consent, all discussion having ceased.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   The preliminary votes to reconsider and second the demand
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   for the previous question were agreed to by a vote of 113 yays to 58 nays.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   In a mid-profound silence, the speaker announced that the yays and nays
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   would be taken directly upon the pending proposition.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   During the call, when prominent Democrats voted aye,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   there was suppressed evidence of applause and gratification
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   exhibited in the galleries.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But it was evident that the great interest centered entirely upon the final result.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And when the presiding officer announced that the resolution was agreed to
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   by yays 119 nays 56,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   the enthusiasm of all present, save a few disappointed politicians,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   knew no bounds, and for several moments the scene was grand and impressive beyond description.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   No attempt was made to suppress the applause which came from all sides,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   everyone feeling that the occasion justified the fullest expression of approbation and joy.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   End of article.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   This recording is in the public domain.
