[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Hello, everybody, and welcome to Simplified Speech, the QLIP series which features clear, natural, and easy to understand English conversations between native speakers.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Joining me as my co-host for today is Indiana.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Hey, Indiana, how's it going?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Hey, Andrew.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I'm doing great, and I'm excited to revisit this topic again, because it was a lot of fun last time.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Yeah, it was a lot of fun, and our listeners enjoyed it as well.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Guys, we're talking about overrated or underrated, and we'll put a link in the description for the first overrated, underrated episode that we recorded a little while ago.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   So if you haven't heard that one yet, maybe you can go back and listen to that one, and we explain the concept, we explain what overrated and underrated means, but Indiana, maybe just in a nutshell, we could catch listeners up if they didn't hear that first episode.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   What does it mean to be overrated or to be underrated?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Sure, so there are things that are popular that are well deserved, but there's also things that are popular that you might think, why do people like this?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Like, this actually isn't very good at all.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So if something is overrated, that means over, this prefix over, it's too much.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   People like it more than it's worth.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   You don't think it's actually that good.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   But if it's underrated, under, so not enough, people don't really appreciate this thing, but you think it's great.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   You think it deserves much more popularity and praise.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So overrated and underrated, we often use these expressions, these adjectives with music or food, you know, oh, that band is so overrated, something like that.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, it's just a way of saying if you think something is awesome or terrible.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And we usually use it to talk about things that are pretty popular, right?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And then we give our impression of that popular thing.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And so Indiana, today you compiled this great list.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   There's like maybe 12 or 13 things on this list and we won't have time to go through all of them, but we'll go through some of them and we'll give our opinions and we'll talk about whether we think they are overrated or underrated.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And we'll get started with that conversation in just a moment.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But before we do, everyone, I want to remind you about the study guide that we have available for this episode and not really just this episode, actually all of our episodes in our entire library have amazing study guides that are very helpful.

[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Hey, Indiana, let's jump in. Let's get started. I'm excited. I really enjoyed our first go around and I think the second go around here to will also be a fun chat and conversation.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So I'll let you do the honors. I'll let you go first. Why don't you choose an item from your list and we'll talk about whether we think it's overrated or underrated.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Okay. My first question for you, I'll put you in the hot seat initially. Okay. Do you think 10,000 steps a day, that goal of walking 10,000 steps a day? Is this overrated or is this underrated?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I think totally underrated. I think it's a great idea to get as much movement in as possible. And 10,000 steps is actually quite a bit of walking. Like, it's not an insignificant amount. It is a lot of walking.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   But our bodies respond to movement and I think your mental health, you feel better and I have my Garmin watch that I wear for running and it tells me I've got right on the front face how many steps that I've done today.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And also when I hit 10,000 steps, it buzzes and there's like a little fireworks show. It's like, yeah, you did it. Go accomplished. So it feels great. I love it whenever I achieve that goal, 10,000 steps. So for me, because of the health benefits because of that dopamine burst that I get when I hit 10,000 steps, I think underrated.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You know what else is underrated? Finding the right way to practice speaking English. A great solution to this is Italki. Italki is an online language learning platform that offers personalized one-on-one lessons with native speaking teachers. So if you're someone who understands English well but freezes up when it's time to speak, Italki is perfect for you.

[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Plus, get feedback and guidance in real time. I've used Italki myself for Korean lessons and had a great experience. The teachers gave me really helpful feedback on my pronunciation and were totally flexible, customizing their lessons to what I wanted to study and focus on.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And here's an awesome suggestion. You could work with your Italki teacher to study a cube-lips episode in depth together. Imagine discussing the idioms we use and practicing pronunciation. That could be a fantastic way to improve your English fluency.

[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And now let's get back to my conversation with Indiana.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   How do you feel about it? What do you think?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I have to go in the different direction in a different direction from you, Andrew. I think it is overrated, not because I think it's bad. I mean, it's like any amount of walking, any exercise that somebody could do is awesome.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I think exercise is really important. It makes everything in your life better when you can exercise.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   The problem that I have with the 10,000 steps a day is it's a made up number. From what I understand, it was just used in a marketing campaign to sell pedometers by a Japanese company in the 80s or the 90s.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It sounds good. 10,000. But there's diminishing returns. This means like as something continues on on a graph, like the benefits slows down after a certain point. Okay. So I read, and now, of course, don't quote me for sure.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   But I listened to a podcast somewhere and I read something that really more like six or seven thousand steps a day is where like the sweet spot is. And after that, if you're walking 10,000 steps, I mean, it's great.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   But you're not really getting that much more. So I don't want people to stress out like, Oh, I'm such a failure. I only walk 5,000 steps a day. That's pretty good. That's why I think that's why I think it's overrated. Like, if you're walking five, six, seven thousand steps, that's wonderful.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Don't, don't beat yourself up over it. So it's a nice goal. But I think we get really stuck on like the perfect number. And that could be harmful. So overrated.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Okay, that's good to know. I've always been curious about where that 10,000 number comes from because it does seem pretty arbitrary. Like, why would 10,000 be the perfect number? But.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Okay, good to know the backstory. And yeah, I think whatever. Just do as many steps as you can a day without killing yourself and totally good for your health. Yeah.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   No matter the number, set your own goal that works for you. Okay, we're going to switch positions here. I'm going to put you in the hot seats, Indiana. I'm going to choose one from your list here.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   This is another like sort of health related one. So we'll stay on the same topic and I'll ask you about bio hacking. What do you think about bio hacking and we'll probably have to explain this.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Maybe we could start with explaining it and then get your opinion on it. But what does it mean bio hacking? We know that hacking is when you like attack somebody else's computer, right? Maybe you try and break into somebody else's computer and change the password
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   or steal their information or I don't know some evil thing like that. But here bio hacking bio means life. So could you spell it out for us? What does it mean exactly bio hacking.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Sure. As far as I understand this is a trend where people get really obsessed and dialed into let me maximize my chances at the perfect health and longevity. Longevity means the duration of your life. How long you can live.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So people who are really into health to such a degree that they're trying to perfect and absolutely dial in like what the perfect number of calories to eat a day or like, you know, the right amount of protein and carbohydrates.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Oh, also if I get this much sunlight in the morning or I do these cold plunges like there's going to be these physical things going on in my body, these reactions, and this is going to maybe add a little bit of longevity to my life or make me that much healthier.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   So bio hacking, it's like you're trying to hack the processes of your body to be as healthy as possible.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I think it is definitely overrated. Again, I really care about health and nutrition and exercise, but to focus so much on these tiny little things just to get like maybe this much healthier.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   If anything could happen, I could get hit by a bus tomorrow. So if I spent the last several years obsessing over these tiny tweaks to my lifestyle, I feel like that is not worth the energy, or, you know, you just don't know what's going to happen. You can't control everything.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So I think it's totally overrated.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Andrew, what is your perspective on bio hacking?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   With you, I also think that it's overrated, maybe not totally overrated. And I think for me personally, it's overrated. I agree with you that we have to live our life instead of like controlling every single variable in life, because there are things that we can't control, right?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Like you could eat perfectly. You could really dial in your sleep, your nutrition, your health, everything. And then you could get hit by a car like while you're trying to cross the street, right?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   We can't control everything in life. So we have that expression, everything in moderation, right?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Of course, it's good to take care of yourself, but in moderation, you don't want to make it your entire personality, your entire lifestyle is just trying to optimize your health.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   But there are some YouTubers. There's a guy, I think his name, and I'll leave maybe a link to his channel in the description for this episode.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I believe his name is Brian Johnson. India, have you seen this guy on YouTube before?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It rings a bell, but I'm not sure. I thought you were going to say Andrew Huberman or something.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   He's kind of like Huberman adjacent, maybe. Andrew Huberman is this doctor who's got a very famous podcast, and he talks a lot about this, about health and nutrition and trying to optimize your health.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   But this guy, Brian Johnson, takes it to the next level, and he does all these different experiments on himself.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And I believe he owned a company during the .com boom economy of the late 1990s, and he made a ton of money, so he's super rich.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And he doesn't work, he just commits all his time to doing experiments on himself and trying to really optimize his health, his fitness, every single aspect of his life.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And he's very, very, very serious about it. It's actually interesting in a way.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   I'm glad that I don't have to live like that, but at the same time, I'm kind of glad that he is choosing to live like that, because I do think that he's learning some interesting things about how the body works
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   and about fitness, and especially as he ages, because I think he's like a decade older than me.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   So it's kind of like he's going through some of the things that I'll have to go through pretty soon, and like he can figure those out for me first.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   I don't know. So that's why I think it's like overrated.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   I don't want to dedicate my whole life to it, but if other people do, and I can get some of the trickle down effects, some of the side effects from those experiments, then yeah, that's good.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   That works for me. Anyways, Indiana, check them out. Brian Johnson. Interesting guy.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Yeah, now that you talked about the fact that he's the guy who had this company is really rich from it, but now he's focusing on this.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   I'm like, "Yes, I know exactly who you're talking about." I clicked. Yes, yes.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Very eclectic, yes. Okay. Good. Why don't we switch away from health and fitness?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   We'll choose a totally different one. Indiana, go for it. What would you like to talk about next?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Pineapple on pizza. How do you feel about the pairing of pineapple with your pizza?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Love it. One of my favorite pizza flavors, to be honest with you. Totally, totally underrated, in my opinion. It's very delicious.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   What do you think? I agree. Yeah, yeah. It is so good. I love it. It makes me very happy.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I think, yeah, I don't know. It's hard to get into why it works. I think everybody has different taste, but I think the sweetness with the tomato sauce, which is already a little sweet, and that salty cheese, amazing. Can't get better.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I'm curious if it's a common topping that's available in Korea for pizza or not, or if you generally only eat this, like maybe if you make pizza at home or you went back to Canada or something.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   As far as I know, Canadians take pride in the fact that Hawaiian pizza is actually from Canada. I don't know if that's true or not, but there's a lot of legends that say that, yeah, Hawaiian pizza is a Canadian invention.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   We're a little bit proud of the style of pizza in Canada. In Korea, I feel like they are very, very creative with the toppings that they put on pizza, and they have such a huge selection of toppings, like things that we would never put on a pizza in North America.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   They put all over pizzas here in Korea, like sweet corn, sweet potatoes, shrimp, like, I don't know, just like a wide variety of toppings that are not very common in North America.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And yeah, you can order Hawaiian pizza. I think it's a pretty controversial flavor here as well. So, like, some people will like it and some people will hate it. So it's not like super, super common, but you can definitely order it.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Sometimes I do order it, but I always have to get like a half and half pizza when I order Hawaiian pizza because my wife doesn't really like it. So I get the Hawaiian half and she gets whatever she wants to order.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   On a related note, Indiana, Korean people often talk about three different controversial foods. They talk about Hawaiian pizza and they talk about mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's like a food that seems like 50% of people love 50% of people hate. What's your take on mint chocolate chip?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   It's not my favorite favorite flavor, but sometimes you are. I am totally in the mood for it as a great flavor. Sometimes it depends on the day. How about you?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Yeah, I like it too. And then the third one is cilantro. Cilantro down with cilantro.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I am. I've heard that some people because of a gene or something, they are predisposed to feeling that it tastes like soap. I do not have that gene. I think it's a delicious herb. Love it in Mexican food. Yeah, how about you?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Yeah, I love it as well. I love all of these things so they don't bother me at all. Okay, let me choose another one here.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Since we're both music people, why don't we talk about this one? Digital music versus vinyl records. Digital music versus vinyl records. What's your take? Which one is overrated? Which one is underrated? What do you think of them?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Well, that's tough because I think certainly digital music is not overrated, but and certainly there is a big surge of popularity in the past few decades back to vinyl records. You might see my final records behind me.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   So clearly I'm participating in this. I think perhaps it's trendy so it might seem overrated. Digital music, I'm going to set that aside. That's just fine. That's good. Not under overrated. Just like we need that.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Yes, but vinyl. I think like it's perhaps a little underrated simply for the experience of being able to have people over and then you have a communal opportunity to take a look at your records and say, what do I want to listen to? Oh, you like this band? Oh, I saw them back in 2012 and you have a conversation.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   You throw it on the record player and it sounds really good. If you have a good setup, it sounds really, really good. Some people who are audio files, we talked about this expression in another episode really, really into audio quality and sound.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   They might say that vinyl is the way to go. So, you know, there's a difference between that and maybe listening to an mp3. I don't know. It depends on who you ask, but I think that whole communal experience, like you're talking about the record and then you throw it on together.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   You put it on and you're listening to like a full album while you're having your dinner party or whatever. I feel like that is very special and you can't really do that in the same way with digital music.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   So underrated is my take. What about, what would you say for this one? And I don't know if you have any vinyl record collections or if you ever have, or what do you think?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Yeah, yeah, I have a big vinyl collection. I probably have like two or three hundred records. So pretty sizable collection and my wife and I listened to records all the time and we enjoy going to use record stores and digging together and trying to find
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   some old hidden gems in the record store. And when you find something, it's so exciting. Recently, I found this record from Montreal, Canada of this Canadian punk band from like, I think it was pressed in 1984, the year that I was born.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And it was here in Seoul and I found this like, it was one of 300. So it was limited to 300 from the year I was born in Seoul, South Korea, this punk record from a nice Canadian band out of Montreal.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   So like, when you find something like that, you're like, Oh my gosh, this is so cool. Like, what is this record doing here? And you wonder about its story and its history. And yeah, I love that.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So I want to say appropriately rated, like, yeah, I don't know, because I think there are good points and bad points about having a record collection. All of the points that you mentioned, I totally agree with those. It's nice to have a physical piece of media.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   I love looking at the artwork. I love holding the album. I love putting it on the record player. Like, there's a tactile experience just pressing the buttons on my record player because I have this old record player and an old amplifier and the buttons are very like heavy.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   You press them. It makes this good satisfying click. And I love that. I like focusing on just one piece of music. When we listen to digital music, often we have just a random playlist, right? So we'll go from one artist to the next artist to the next artist.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Here, you're really focusing on just one album and one band and one work. So I love that. But at the same time, they take up a lot of space. And it's also pretty expensive. It's an expensive hobby.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   So those two major negatives, I think, maybe make it appropriately rate is so much so that I've been thinking about getting back into CDs, Indiana, because you can get the physical experience.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   You can get the high quality experience. You can get the physical media. You can listen to one album only.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And they're just so much smaller and so much cheaper. So I was thinking about going full circle and getting back into CDs. I told my wife I wanted to buy a CD player and she said, "We have no room for it." So I still have to twist her arm a little bit more, I guess.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Yeah, that's interesting. I don't know. I don't think I know anybody in my circles yet who has moved from vinyl back to CDs or moved from MP3, just digital to CDs. I don't think that's hit my group yet, but that's an interesting prospect.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I think it's the next step. I think CDs are going to come back in a big way. Just my prediction. Should we do one more? Should we do one final one before we wrap up here?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I think it's your turn, right? Do you want to choose one?
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   You can do being famous. Now you might have an interesting take on this one since you have been doing the QLIP podcast for so long. Many people know you in this community, so maybe you have an interesting take on your level of fame, right?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Overrated or underrated, niche community fame is what you have. You're a very, very niche community fame. Yeah, my level of fame is like 0.001 in the world.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   I would say, I think being famous, for me, I think I would hate to be famous. I'm a very private person. And so I would say overrated. I, of course, like, I love what I do here at QLIP, and I love sharing my life and helping people learn English and achieve their goals through being able to share my life.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But as a private person does sometimes make me feel a little bit uncomfortable, like how much I should share with people and even like, you know, we're filming video right now in addition to the audio, so having my house appear and just putting that on the Internet always like sketches me out a little bit.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Because I'm like 0.001% famous, like very, very, very rarely get recognized has happened a few times. Like there are people who listen in Korea and I do live in Korea. So from time to time, some people have stopped me and it's always been very positive and really actually fun to have that kind of experience.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Thankfully, I'm not famous, famous, so I don't have to deal with that, but I could just imagine it being magnified by like a million. How uncomfortable that would be. I wouldn't want it. I don't think. So for me, yeah, overrated, I think.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   I guess being respected and being admired and being rich, those are all good things, but just having like stalker fans and not having any privacy, that would be really tough, I think.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Absolutely. I would have to agree with you 100%. But yeah, I think with a niche community, like a small, you're famous, just among a really small group of people who have a certain interest or activity that they like.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I think that is kind of cool, like, you know, because the frequency of those stops are like getting recognized. It's going to be very low and hopefully it would be respectful and nice interaction that you have with people. So I feel like that low level of fame could be pretty cool.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Maybe it's appropriately rated, but in general, it completely agree with you, like having everybody pick apart your tweets from your whole life, or if you make any facial expression and in public on video and then somebody's reading into it like, oh, like, you know, what's wrong with her was, I don't know.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   It's like that level of scrutiny for famous people seems like it would ruin my life, so agreed overrated.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   I read a YouTube comment recently that freaked me out one of my favorite runners. He's got a YouTube channel and he vlogs about his running journey.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And in the comments, one person commented was like, oh, is that the same sushi restaurant as you yesterday? And I was sitting right beside you, but I wanted to give you your privacy so I didn't say anything.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   But you could just imagine that he's probably like listening to the entire conversation. I think that's like almost worse. It's like, it's like there's people out there who know who you are, and then they're like listening in and watching you and you don't have that privacy.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And even if they don't interrupt you, it's just like a little bit scary. So yeah, Q lip listeners, if you see me or Indiana out in the wild, just say hello. We're friendly.
