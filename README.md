# Kipty

> **Note:** Audio transcriptions in Kipty are generated using the *base* and *tiny* Whisper.cpp models. As these are lightweight models, transcription errors may occur, especially with noisy audio or fast speech.

Kipty is a mobile application designed to create **audio transcriptions** to help with learning English.  
It allows you to follow along with what is being said in an audio while reading its transcription, which is especially useful for improving listening and vocabulary.

Originally created as a personal tool to support my own English-learning journey, Kipty is most commonly used to transcribe **podcast audio**, but it can be applied to any supported audio source.
