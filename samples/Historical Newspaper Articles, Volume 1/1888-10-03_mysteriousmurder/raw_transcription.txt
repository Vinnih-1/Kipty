[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   Another mysterious murder brought to light, from the New York Times, October 3, 1888,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.760]   recorded for LibraVox.org by Leanne Howlett.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.520]   London's record of crime, another mysterious murder brought to light from our own correspondent.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.680]   London, October 2.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.380]   The Carnival of Blood continues is an extremely strange state of affairs altogether, because
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.320]   before the White Chapel murders began, several papers called attention to the fact that there
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.700]   had been more sanguinary crimes committed in London and its vicinity this summer than
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.640]   ever before known in this city in the same space of time.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.400]   The White Chapel assassin has now murdered six victims, and crimes occur daily, but pass
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.600]   unnoticed in view of the master murderer's work in the East End.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.600]   Last Friday, a man in Pimlico sharpened a knife in the presence of his wife, threatening
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   her all the time, and then cut off her head with it.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.360]   This rather dramatic crime passed off without particular notice, the paper is giving it
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.520]   only a brief paragraph.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.480]   This afternoon, however, a discovery was made which was even more horrible than any of the
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.200]   recent deeds.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.360]   A few days ago, the right arm of a woman was found by some boys in the Thames near Waterloo
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.600]   Bridge.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.000]   It belonged to a young woman, was plump, shapely, and graceful, and had been rudely hacked from
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.480]   the shoulder.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.200]   It was believed at first to be evidence of another murder, but as no young woman had
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.960]   been murdered so far as known, the theory that it was a specimen from a dissecting room
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.760]   was generally adopted.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.840]   The police took immediate possession of it, and refused absolutely either to give any
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.960]   information concerning its appearance, or to say whether it pointed to a fresh crime.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.400]   The boys who found it said it was a well-preserved human arm, but scarred and excoriated in many
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.840]   places as if from the action of quick line.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.280]   The police refused to say yes or no to this, but hinted or said that it was all a mistake,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.200]   and that the thing found was merely the old skeleton of an arm, with no flesh on it.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.240]   This afternoon, however, a discovery was made in Pimlico, a mile up the river from where
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.080]   the arm was found, which throws some light on the mystery.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.840]   There are some old buildings on the embankment, close to the parliament houses, and almost
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.960]   in the shadow of Westminster Abbey, and workmen are engaged in tearing these down to prepare
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.800]   a site for the new police station.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.920]   As they destroyed an old vault today, they came upon a shapeless mass, which upon closer
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.600]   inspection proved to be the trunk of the body of a young woman, perhaps thirty years old.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.960]   The horribly mutilated head, arms, and legs have been cut off and carried away, only the
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.120]   trunk being left.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.600]   The body was not ripped, however, as in the white chapel cases.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.760]   It was very much decomposed, and in fact must have been there many weeks.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.400]   The police removed it to a mortuary, and tomorrow morning the doctors will adjust the
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.480]   arms beside it to see if they fit.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.240]   It is now admitted by the police that the second arm found matched the first one.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.760]   Should the arms belong to the body, they may serve as a clue.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.520]   They seem in a much better state of preservation than the body, however, and should they not
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.320]   fit, they will stand as evidence of a second horrible crime yet unrevealed.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.600]   There is no clue to the identity of the murdered woman.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   In fact, so many people disappear daily in this great city that the record of disappearances
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.520]   will not be of much assistance.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.840]   This crime, single or double as it may be, has no connection with the white chapel murders.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.400]   Its method is different in every possible respect, and should it prove to be two murders
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.680]   instead of one, it will show an independent operation of the white chapel nature.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.560]   Pimlico is two miles from white chapel.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.520]   The master murderer of the latter district has done all his work in one small area, and
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.680]   there is no clue whatever to him.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.000]   Tonight, a crazy man with blood stains on his coat, who was flourishing surgical knives
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.040]   and making a general spectacle of himself in Milk Street in the city, was arrested, but
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.600]   he proves to be innocent.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.120]   Another suspect was arrested in Chingford, ifling forest today, but he easily proved
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.480]   an alibi.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.320]   No one suspected is at present in custody, though all Scotland Yard is at work on the
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.800]   case.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.440]   Also, Associated Press Dispatch, London, October 2nd, an inquest was held today on the body
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.800]   of the woman found murdered in a narrow court off Burner Street Sunday morning.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.480]   A sister of the victim was called and opposed that she was awoke at one twenty o'clock Sunday
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.520]   morning and heard a sound which she thought was made by a person falling to the ground.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.640]   She was convinced that her sister was dead and after reading the accounts of the murder
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.080]   in the newspapers, went to the morgue and recognized the body of the murdered woman
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.920]   as out of her sister.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.680]   The house in which the witness resides is several miles from Burner Street.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.040]   The murderer is believed to have been committed at about twelve fifty o'clock Sunday morning.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.520]   End of article.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.440]   This recording is in the public domain.
