[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Hey everybody, my name is Andrew.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.020]   - And I'm Suzanne.
[00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.480]   - And you're listening to Q-Lips.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.120]   - Hey there Suzanne.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.520]   - Hey Andrew, how are you?
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.520]   - I am fantastic, how are you doing?
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.080]   - Good.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.920]   - Suzanne, we are back today with another episode
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.320]   of our Speak Easy series.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.640]   And this is our Pronunciation series
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.760]   where we focus on how to pronounce
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.600]   all of the wonderful sounds in the English language.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.760]   And today we have quite an interesting topic, I think.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.080]   - Yes.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.680]   Today we're gonna talk about (humming)
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.540]   the dreaded word stress.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   - Words stress.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.560]   - I know many of you have come to me
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.080]   or a lot of students in my classes, in my workshops,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.560]   always ask, how do I know where to put the emphasis
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.000]   in a word?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.200]   And we talk about sentence stress,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.240]   what word in a sentence to stress.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.800]   But more importantly, we have to know what syllable
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.080]   to stress in a word that's two or more syllables long.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.820]   So we're not gonna cover all of the word stress
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.160]   in the world today, but just one aspect of it.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.360]   - Okay, just one aspect of word stress
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.420]   and what aspect is that?
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.800]   - We're going to look at compound nouns.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.380]   Compound nouns, okay, compounds nouns.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.120]   - Yes.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.040]   - Well, maybe we can start with explaining a compound noun.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.440]   Our listeners might be unfamiliar with that term.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.480]   What is a compound noun?
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.040]   - So any compound word is when you take two words,
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.760]   so they're separate words completely.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.480]   Maybe it's like in a compound noun situation,
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   it's maybe an adjective and a noun or a noun and a noun.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.680]   And we bring them together.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.840]   Sometimes they attach and sometimes there's a space
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.760]   between them, but we put them together
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.600]   to make a whole new noun, a whole new concept,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.680]   a whole new person, place, thing, idea or concept.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.680]   So for example, if we have like the word blackboard,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.480]   we have the word black, which is an adjective
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.680]   and board, which is a noun.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.360]   And separately, they're two totally completely distinct
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   and different things and meanings.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.400]   However, when we bring them together,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.040]   they create a very specific object.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.840]   They become a blackboard.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.240]   - That is right, that's a very good example.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.640]   So Suzanne, I'm really excited to hear what you have to say
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.040]   about word stress on compound nouns,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.960]   but just before we get into that lesson,
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.760]   I would like to remind all of our listeners out there
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.920]   that there is a study guide for this episode.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.360]   And if you'd like to access it,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.520]   you just have to visit our website, qlips.com.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.920]   And in the study guide for this episode,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   we have extra recordings and some exercises
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.680]   that you can practice with to help make your pronunciation
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.820]   sound, well, more like Suzanne's and mine.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.960]   (laughing)
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.120]   All right, Sue, so let's jump into it.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.960]   - Yeah.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.940]   - What's the plan for today?
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.080]   - Yeah, so first we're going to listen to a sample dialogue.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.040]   I know, just to warm things up.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.360]   And we're going to see if we can hear,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   if we can distinguish any compound nouns
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.720]   that are in the dialogue.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.840]   And see if we can maybe just by listening,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.500]   notice some word stress patterns
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.640]   that are going on with those compound nouns.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.480]   - Sounds good.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.040]   - So everybody, pay attention to the dialogue.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   You're going to want to keep your ears open for two things.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   Okay, compound nouns and where the emphasis,
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.320]   the stress is placed when we pronounce
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.440]   these compound nouns.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.720]   - Exactly.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.480]   - All right, Sue, let's get to that dialogue right now.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.320]   - Yeah.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.440]   (clicking)
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.080]   Hey, did you see my textbook on the bookshelf?
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.720]   - Did you put it there this afternoon?
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.360]   - Yeah, with my yellow lunch box.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.320]   - Hmm, that's weird.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.400]   Maybe you brought it into the bathroom,
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.480]   or maybe check the biology classroom.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.640]   I think I saw it there next to the stack of notebooks.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.360]   - Oh yeah, I think you're right.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.000]   I must have left it on the countertop.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.840]   Thanks.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.440]   - Okay, great.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.320]   So let's listen to that one more time,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.480]   and this time we're going to slow it down a bit.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.680]   So once again, everyone really pay attention
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.040]   to the compound nouns and the stress that we put on them.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.400]   So here we go.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.920]   - Hey, did you see my textbook on the bookshelf?
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.240]   - Did you put it there this afternoon?
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.680]   - Yeah, with my yellow lunch box.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.280]   - Hmm, that's weird.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.040]   Maybe you brought it into the bathroom,
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.080]   or maybe check the biology classroom.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.640]   I think I saw it there next to the stack of notebooks.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.040]   - Oh yeah, I think you're right.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.960]   I must have left it on the countertop.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.800]   Thanks.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.560]   (electronic music)
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   - So Andrew, did you hear any compound nouns
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.800]   in that dialogue?
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.480]   - I heard quite a few actually.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.960]   The start of the dialogue,
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.520]   I heard textbook and bookshelf.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   And then I also heard lunch box, bathroom, classroom,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.200]   and notebooks.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.600]   There were a lot in that dialogue.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.080]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.240]   And also there's countertop, right?
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.280]   Countertop also.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.640]   - Oh yeah, countertop.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.640]   - Did you notice a pattern or any kind of rhythm
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.480]   that popped up for you in hearing those?
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.680]   - Okay, let's see.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.320]   I'm gonna say them one more time
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.880]   to see if I can find the pattern, okay?
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   So textbook, bookshelf, lunch box.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.920]   - Yeah, I guess they all seem to have the emphasis
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.200]   on the first word, like the first syllable
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.240]   of the compound noun.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.400]   - Taching, exactly.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.620]   We have a winner.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.040]   That's right.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.720]   So the emphasis is on the first word
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.200]   or the first part of the compound.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.160]   And this is because, do you wanna know why?
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.440]   - Tell me, please.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.080]   - So this is because in most compound nouns,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.560]   the stress is on the first word or first part
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   because you're describing what kind of noun it is.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.600]   So usually in a compound noun,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.240]   we have an adjective plus a noun or a noun plus a noun.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.560]   So our sort of second word,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.280]   it's always kind of like when we look at a word
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.960]   we have a root word and sometimes we have a suffix
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.240]   or a prefix, but we always look at the root word
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.640]   for the meaning.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   Well, our second word is kind of like our anchor word, right?
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.320]   For example, we have textbook.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.560]   So book is our thing.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.480]   But the first thing, the first part
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.480]   is describing what kind of book, what kind of thing it is.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.800]   So we put the stress on text
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.560]   because it's helping us describe the kind of book it is.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   So if it's a picture book or a children's book,
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.400]   we stress that first part, right?
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.760]   Picture book, children's book, textbook.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.480]   So that we're knowing what kind of book it is.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.080]   - Great explanation, Suzanne.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.960]   - And I think I got it, so let's take lunch box, for example.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.800]   Okay, it's not just any box,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.680]   it's a box that you carry your luncheon.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.160]   So we need to put the emphasis on lunch, right?
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.360]   It's a lunch box.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.440]   - Right.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.440]   - And I guess if we're talking about a classroom,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.040]   for example, again, it's not just any room,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.120]   it's a room where you study.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.120]   It's a classroom.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   So we put the stress on that first element, class.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.640]   - Exactly, because it's really helping us to define
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.240]   and make more specific the kind of thing
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.500]   that we're talking about.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:22.120]   - And as always, the best way I think to improve
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.040]   your pronunciation, or one of the best ways,
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.560]   is to listen to a lot of English.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.560]   Listen to a lot of Q-Lips podcasts,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.340]   watch a lot of Netflix.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.520]   Listen to the radio, get your input in,
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.720]   because through listening, you'll be able to hear
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   these things, and once you hear them,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.560]   then you can produce them in your own speech as well.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   - Exactly.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.840]   - Suzanne, I think that about brings us
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.400]   to the end of today's episode.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.320]   - Awesome.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.520]   - Thanks, Suzanne, for teaching us all about
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.200]   word stress and compound nouns today.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.520]   And everyone, one more time, please remember to download
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.800]   the study guide for this episode.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   It's awesome, and it's available on qlips.com.
