[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.720]   Great excitement was occasion this morning when it was reported that another woman had
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.480]   been murdered and mutilated in White Chappell.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.000]   The police immediately formed a cordon around the premises and an enormous crowd soon gathered.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.480]   It was learned that another murder had been attempted upon a low woman by a man who had
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.960]   accompanied her to her lodging, but that in this instance had work had been frustrated.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.600]   According to the woman's story, the man had seized her and struck her once in the throat
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.000]   with a knife.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   She had struggled desperately and had succeeded in freeing herself from the man's grasp and
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.840]   had screamed for help.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.520]   Her cries had alarmed the man he had fled without attempting any further violence.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.320]   Some of the neighbors who had heard the woman's screams followed the murderer for about 300
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.240]   yards when he disappeared from their sight.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.960]   The woman says she is fully able to identify the man and gave the description of him to
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   the police.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.480]   The police are hopeful of soon capturing him.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.480]   And later, investigations by the police showed that the White Chappell woman who reported
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.880]   this morning that she had been attacked by a man who went to her lodgings with her is
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.680]   of the lowest order.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.520]   She suffered only a slight abrasion of the skin on her throat and the police placed no
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.800]   credit in her story of an attack.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.240]   They believed that she inflicted the injury herself while she was drunk.
