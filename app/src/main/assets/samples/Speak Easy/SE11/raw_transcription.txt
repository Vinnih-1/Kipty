[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Hey everybody, my name is Andrew, and I'm Suzanne, and you're listening to Q-Lips.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.240]   Hello friends, welcome back to another episode in our Speak Easy series.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.760]   This is the series where we teach you some great tips to help your English pronunciation
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:38.320]   sound more natural, more comprehensible, more understandable, and today I'm joined by the
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.960]   resident pronunciation expert here at Q-Lips Suzanne, Suzanne, how are you?
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960]   Thanks so much, Andrew, for that lovely introduction.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.240]   I'm good, I'm good, I'm excited to talk about our topic today.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.760]   How are you doing?
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.860]   I'm doing great, thank you for asking, and yeah Suzanne, we have a really, I think, important
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.720]   lesson here today for many of our learners, especially learners from Asia, maybe from
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   Japan and Korea, and maybe from some other countries too, but today's topic is how to
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.600]   differentiate between R and L, R and L, and I know many English learners say that this
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.400]   is one of the most difficult things to do in English, one of the most difficult pronunciation
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.440]   aspects of English, so I'm happy that we are covering this topic today.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   Yeah, me too, and I hope that it at least gives people a little motivation, you know,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.760]   some quick tools that you can use and apply, and don't be worried that it doesn't work
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.600]   right away, it's a process.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:05.200]   Yeah, so this is kind of a first step into how to both here and pronounce the differences
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.680]   between R and L.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.520]   Yeah, but before we jump into our topic, the R and the L, we'd like to remind you guys
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:24.560]   that the best way to study with Q-Lips and this episode is to download the study guide
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.960]   for this episode, so you can go to Qlips.com and download the study guide for this episode.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.600]   It will have a lot of great information and exercises for you to practice.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.920]   Okay, perfect.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.800]   So Sue, I know through my experience learning Korean and also learning French a little
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.360]   bit that when you're learning a new language, you're going to encounter sounds that are
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   not in your native language.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.280]   You have to learn a whole new phonological system.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.880]   There's new and novel ways to pronounce certain sounds that your mouth and your ears are just
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.440]   not used to, right?
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   Absolutely.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.960]   It's just like learning new vocabulary words.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:25.000]   We also have a kind of sound vocabulary and sometimes those sounds are not the same in
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.560]   every language.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.320]   So like, for example, when I was first learning French, it was confusing to differentiate
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:49.000]   the sounds ich as in ich or ich like the street ich and ich as in like the English ich.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.240]   I thought it was all ich.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.680]   I didn't realize there was another sound and it took me a while to understand that those
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.120]   are two different sounds in French.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:12.400]   Yeah, I have a similar experience with Korean some vowel sounds that are just not in English.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   For example, there's this kind of weird diphthong vowel ich in Korean and that's just not in
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.960]   English at all.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.040]   So trying to hear that at first was really strange for me and the pronunciation for it
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   too.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.800]   Very strange.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.720]   So yeah, I've run into this as well.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.320]   Yeah, because you're trying to make it work in your and what you know in your first language.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   So it's hard.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   Yeah, you're just trying to map these on to like what you already know in English, right?
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.360]   And I'm sure that, you know, if you're a Japanese learner of English and you're trying to differentiate
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.480]   between R and L, you're just going to put R and L on to what you already know in Japanese.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.960]   That's close to these sounds.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960]   Exactly.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:13.920]   And the thing about R and L that we need to remember is that unlike TH, where TH sound
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:23.520]   or like the, or the, you know, like the, it's the, the TH sound doesn't really carry a big
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:32.240]   functional load, meaning if you say a different sound, like the instead of the, it's okay.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.960]   We understand what you're saying.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:46.720]   So comprehension and communication does not break down.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.200]   However, R and L do carry a high, they have a high functional load.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:56.320]   And they can really change words into other words if they're mismatched or if it's confused.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.280]   And so you can actually have some communication breakdown totally.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.520]   And what you mean here, Sue, by functional load is that these sounds just have a lot
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.800]   of meaning, right?
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.360]   Meaning can change greatly.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.440]   And one of the classic examples that I joke about with my students all the time, because
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.680]   I live in Korea, I teach Korean students and this is an area of pronunciation that's very
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.080]   difficult for many beginner level Korean students.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.920]   And so one of the things that we joke about all the time is the difference between rice
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   and lice.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   Yes.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   Yes.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.800]   If you say, ah, I would like some rice, then this means that you want some food, right?
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   Yes.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   If you say I want some lice, then the person you're talking to is going to look at you
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.680]   very strangely and with horror on their face because lice is a, an insect and usually an
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.000]   insect that we consider to be very dirty because it lives on humans in their hair, right?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   They're gross.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You don't want that.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   All right.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.400]   So here's an example where this one sound, the difference between rice and lice, this
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   can vastly change the meaning of the sentence.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   Yes.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.520]   So one reason why R and L are difficult is also because R, for example, is what we
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:31.560]   call an approximate because it doesn't have one place of articulation.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.680]   Your tongue is kind of hanging out in the middle of your mouth in sort of an ambiguous
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.080]   place, kind of just the middle of nowhere in the middle of your mouth in a shape.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.480]   And it's not really touching anything.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.000]   It's not really vibrating anywhere.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.400]   It's just sort of standing up straight in inside your mouth.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:02.320]   So it kind of has, it's almost like you're sort of approximating a position.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:10.400]   So not everybody's R position is exactly the same because it doesn't have a fixed point,
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   right?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:17.120]   It doesn't have anything that it's going to like push up against like a ba, ba, ba,
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120]   or something like that.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120]   Like a B, right?
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.880]   Has the two lips are just hitting up against each other.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.560]   It's a little trickier, I would say, in that regard.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.760]   Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:35.520]   I would also add that R is very difficult to physically see, even if you're looking at
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.720]   someone's mouth while they're talking.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.920]   It's really hard to see where their tongue is because the mouth is kind of closed and
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.000]   you can't really see the shape of the tongue.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Yes.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.600]   In a awkward, strange shape too, as opposed to some other sounds that are really easy
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.120]   to get a visual on, right?
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.120]   Right.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:04.680]   So that's another element that makes it difficult is the visual aspect is taken away when learning
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.640]   how to make an R.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.640]   Absolutely.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.200]   It's actually one of the last sounds that kids learn because it is.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.400]   It's hard when they're learning their first language as English because it's hard to see.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:24.320]   So one of the things that I think can be very helpful because most, I'm sure you guys out
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:33.440]   there have trouble perceiving, perceiving the R and L sound in pronunciation that you
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.160]   hear, it can be hard to distinguish it when you hear English spoken.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.540]   You could probably distinguish it when you're reading because they are letters that look
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.540]   different.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.440]   They don't look the same and you're, you know, you're reading the words.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:58.840]   So I'm going to walk you through how to feel the difference in your vocal tract.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:05.000]   And Andrew, I'm going to make a video of this as well to accompany this episode so that you
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.080]   guys will actually be able to see what I'm doing with my mouth, not just talk on the
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   podcast.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   Okay.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.680]   So guys, if you want to check that video out, we'll post it onto our YouTube account.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.440]   So just head on over to YouTube search for the queue lips English podcast.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.520]   You'll be able to find our channel and watch that video.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.520]   Awesome.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:40.960]   So I find that when you can feel and know sort of like a dance step, what kind of movements
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.400]   you need to make with your mouth, it can help you know, okay, when I make an R or when I
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:54.160]   see R, when I'm reading out loud, I know that my mouth goes in this pose.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:01.080]   And when I see an L in my reading, I know my mouth goes in this pose.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.480]   Just to help you start to see and feel and make the difference.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   Okay.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.280]   It's almost like you're learning a new yoga pose or the proper movement for lifting weights
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   or something, right?
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.200]   It's really a physical action.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.200]   It really is.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:25.080]   It's like maybe you were trained in ballet and now we're asking you to do hip hop.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.880]   So it's confusing.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.380]   It can be hard because you're used to standing in one pose, you know, you're just standing
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.200]   with your, your neck stretched high and your chest out and your spine straight.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.400]   But with hip hop, we know you need to be a little more loose, a little more relaxed.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   Totally.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:47.360]   I'm thinking of when I used to play in a band, I played guitar and I'm kind of a self taught
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   guitarist.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   I never took lessons.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.760]   But some of the other guys in the band, they studied guitar and they learned, you know,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.480]   the quote, unquote, correct way to play.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.840]   And then they'd be showing me, oh, Andrew, you should play this at this point.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.720]   And then I'd say, okay, show me, how do you play that?
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.120]   And they'd play it a different way than I would naturally want to play it.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:18.520]   And so trying to learn that new style to play is just so difficult because you're so accustomed
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:24.320]   to doing something one way and when you have to switch your thinking, switch your way of
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.120]   moving your fingers, it's very confusing.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.000]   That's a great analogy here, I think, for how to learn these new sounds in English.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.400]   But Sue, I'm rambling.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   Let's get to it.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   Let's get to it.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   Of course.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   Okay.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.840]   So Andrew, I want you to repeat after me, I'm going to take you through, and you guys
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:47.760]   out there do the same, I'm going to take you through a series of sounds that will help
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:55.680]   lead your tongue to the correct area, again, remember, ours are kind of made and everyone
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.520]   makes them a little bit differently.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:04.760]   But in the general area of where your tongue needs to be for an R sound.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.760]   Okay.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:12.120]   Now, I want you to think that your lips for this whole exercise are going to be in like
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:19.400]   a rectangle position, like if you had a noisy kid next to you and you were like, Hey, shh,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:24.440]   and you tell them to shh, your lips kind of splay out.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.880]   They're kind of, you know, energized, have muscularity in them.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.880]   And they're kind of in a square or rectangle.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   Exactly.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   They're pushed out.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   Yes.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.440]   And it's almost like a kiss shape.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.680]   Like a duck, like an open duck lips.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   Duck lips.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   Selfie lips.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:57.000]   So, okay, so even though we're going to make some sounds that normally you would not put
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.960]   your lips in this position, just do that for now, just to have as an exercise.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Okay.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:14.760]   first we're going to start with, we're going to go da da da da da da da da da d. Great.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:23.680]   Now we're going to add a Z sound after the D. So we have our tongue is tapping on the
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.760]   top of our palate and now we're going to bring it down and back just a bit. So we're
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:43.000]   going to go da da da da da da d. Z. Okay. Da da da da da da d. Z. Good. And just make
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.560]   sure that you elongate the Z sound. So you're going to go da da da da d. Z. Okay. Da da
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:58.760]   da da da d. Z. Good. Just because you want, you want to make sure that you get each, each
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:05.120]   element in there. Okay. Sure. Okay. Now we're going to add, after the Z sound, we're going
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:14.800]   to add a Z. So just like you would say, sh. Now we're just adding voice like a Z, like
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:29.280]   garage, the sound in garage. Z. Okay. So we're going to go da da da da da da da d. Z. Z.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:38.600]   Oh, okay. Getting hard here. It's getting a little difficult. Da da da da da da d. Z.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.000]   Awesome. That's it. Excellent. Hope you guys are following along. Guys, if I can do it,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.680]   you can do it too. Yes. This is why you need the study guide, right? It's really important
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.280]   to have the study guide. Okay. So now on our next step, we're going to forget about the
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:06.320]   da and the Z, the D and the Z. And we're just going to start with the Z sound. But after
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:15.160]   the Z, think about moving your tongue back to float in the middle of your mouth. And we're
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:36.200]   going to add the R sound. So it'll sound like this. Z. Z. Z. Z. Z. Good. Do you feel
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:42.680]   that you're moving your tongue? That's kind of vibrating on the top of your palate just
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:49.160]   a bit for the Z. Just barely. And then it pulls back a bit. And it's sort of floating
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:56.920]   in the middle of the of your mouth. Yeah. In a reflex way. You can absolutely feel your
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:04.880]   tongue moving throughout that exercise. Good. Good. So now we're just going to stick here
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:12.680]   with the Z. But we're going to take away the E and just go right into the R. Okay. Okay.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:27.040]   So we'll go Z. Good. Now stay in that position. Don't move out of that position and continue
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:40.800]   with the R. Okay. Good. Now where do you feel your tongue in your mouth? Just just from
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:48.320]   that exercise. Where do you feel your tongue placed? It feels like it is folded in the
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.680]   middle of my mouth. So it's not touching the top of my mouth. It's not touching the bottom.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:01.440]   It's hovering, floating in the middle. And it's there's a bend to it. It's not straight.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.880]   That's the perfect spot. Are you a native speaker? You must be a native speaker. Maybe
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:13.680]   I have an advantage with the English R. But believe you me, French R, Spanish R. Not easy.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:21.040]   Not easy at all. Even like even some dialects of English, like the Scottish R can't do it.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:27.600]   Right? I know. That's crazy, isn't it? Yeah. That's so crazy. You can do it. Good job,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:38.080]   Zu. What if we try just a few phrases to see if we can really get the R in different environments?
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:46.320]   So in different positions of the word. Okay. Yeah. Let's practice that. Okay. So I'll say them.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:52.720]   And then if you guys just repeat them, what do you think? Yeah. Okay. I will repeat after you.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:19:00.320]   And listeners, why don't you repeat along with me? Now, just for exercise purposes,
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:06.480]   I'm going to start each phrase with a just to get into it. Okay. Okay. So we'll go
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:33.680]   read the words. Zr read the words. Yeah. Great. Zr wrote the wrong words. Zr wrote the wrong words.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:49.520]   Good. Zr the author of the article. Zr the author of the article.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:08.320]   Yeah. Let's try one more. Zr order another round. Zr order another round.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:20.160]   Awesome. Now, just a quick thing you might notice, Andrew, that the D that you just said in order
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:28.880]   is actually a lot further back than a normal D. Do you feel that? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Order.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:38.000]   Order. That's a unique one. It is because R is a high maintenance letter. It's a high maintenance
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.720]   friend. It's always making you come over to their house, going over to their side of the town.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:53.440]   R is pulling other sounds with it. So just know if it sounds or feels a little different, it's okay.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.960]   All right. Good to know. All right. Order another round. I like it.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:06.800]   Let's let's jump into some L quickly. It's not as complicated as the R.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:14.160]   Right. The thing to know about L is that there's kind of two different L sounds in English.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:22.800]   There's a bright L sound that you hear at the beginning of syllables and then there's also a
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   darker L sound that you hear at the coda or the end of a syllable like pool or school or old.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:43.920]   Can you hear that? Yeah. It's a little bit darker. My mouth is more closed. Okay. So when we refer
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:51.840]   to a dark L sound, we mean an L that is at the end of a word, like the examples you just gave us.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:22:00.800]   Pool, school, old, like this? Exactly. Yes. Okay. It could be a word or syllable, right? It could be
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:08.480]   follow, follow, follow. Right. Okay. But it's at the final part of the word follow.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.320]   It's not in the beginning. It's not the word initial sound. It's not the word initial sound.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:20.160]   It's the word. It's usually in at the end of a syllable. So like if you have fall,
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:29.360]   right? Fall low. The ending of fall is going to be a little bit of a darker L.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:38.480]   If that makes sense. Gotcha. Okay. Syllable final. So the bright L is probably the more common L
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:45.680]   and that comes at the beginning of a word. Okay. And that's like in words like light and lift
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:59.040]   and landing. Light, lift, landing. Yep. Exactly. Now for the purposes of your second language,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:07.440]   if you have trouble with R and L, I suggest for right now in your practice to just do
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:14.800]   a bright L because this is going to be the most different from an R. I just wanted you to know
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.720]   what those two L's were just so that someone doesn't come back to me and say, yeah, but this
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:28.800]   L sounds different. So, but I want you to really think of doing a bright L for the most part for
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   now. And then you can always adjust. Okay. The main thing is to add a smile to your lips
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:43.920]   because you're going to want to retract your lips or smile and get the lips out of the way.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.840]   You want them back. You want to open your mouth and have a brighter sound.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:56.720]   Have more space in your mouth for the sound and air to flow. So really retract your lips
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:04.080]   into a smile. Okay. Then you're going to force the tip of the tongue forward almost like it's
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:11.040]   sticking out from between your teeth, almost like a TH. You're going to go all the way forward.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   Yes. Yes. So you really want to almost, you should almost see the tip of your tongue coming out,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:28.160]   the opposite of an R, right? The R is pulled back, your lips are kind of closed or rounded over.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:40.320]   This we're smiling. The tongue is coming out. So, oh, oh, good. Yeah. I can feel it that you are
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:48.560]   smiling and your tongue is, yeah, in a very different position than the R, right? The tip of your tongue
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:54.640]   is right there in the crack of your teeth. Yeah. And you should feel your palate, right? You should
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:01.200]   feel that alveolar ridge or the palate on top, right behind your teeth. Your tongue is up there,
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.480]   right there. It's touching something where the R, you don't touch anything.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:13.360]   Right. The R is just floating in the middle of your mouth. Yes. And the L, there is that physical
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:19.840]   contact with the mouth. Yes. Yeah. Good. So why don't we practice just a few
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:28.480]   phrases with L, but this time we're, I want you guys to over exaggerate your pronunciation. So
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:37.520]   really smile big, really stick the tongue forward just to feel that, you know, that kind of extra
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:46.800]   energy so that you're really hitting that form. Okay. So big smiles, everyone. Yeah.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:53.440]   Let's try our best to be happy here. Okay. And Suzanne, let's do the same thing. You
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:26:00.880]   give us the example and then listeners, we will repeat me and the listeners together at the same
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:10.400]   time. Okay. We're going to start with one of my favorite little phrases. Eleven elephants.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.200]   Eleven elephants.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:27.120]   Good. All right. We also are going to try listen to the laughter.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.760]   Listen to the laughter.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:40.400]   Let's just try two more little lady. Little lady.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:54.960]   My least favorite phrase, last call for alcohol. Just kidding. Last call for alcohol.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:06.000]   One of the main takeaways, Andrew, is that the R when we make the R sound, the tongue is not touching
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.360]   anything. It's floating up, retracted in the middle of the mouth. Whereas with the L sound,
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:21.760]   the tip of our tongue is touching right behind our upper front teeth. So it's really right there
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:28.640]   on the, almost on the outside of our mouths. And so just one more take home that I think is important
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:36.240]   for everybody here is to know that as we mentioned earlier, R and L carry a lot of meaning.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:44.560]   And this is one area that you're going to want to be very careful about because the meaning of
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.480]   your sentence can change dramatically. If you mispronounce one of these letters, right? Like we
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:57.680]   gave the rice lice example. So maybe some other aspects of English pronunciation, you can
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:04.480]   be a little less cautious. You can relax a little bit. People will still be able to understand you.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:12.240]   For example, that TH example that you gave earlier. But with this one, you may find that
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:18.800]   your listener doesn't understand you or is confused if you pronounce these two sounds incorrectly.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:28.480]   Yes, we have like deer and deal or hear and heal, right? These are all really minimal pairs here.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:35.680]   So it's important to get those, get those right. I just want to add one thing, Andrew.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:44.560]   There's a great resource you guys out there that's free for you to work on your perception
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:53.520]   of different sounds. And it's called the English accent coach is the website. And it was created by
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:00.880]   a researcher, a colleague of ours. And you can go on there for free, play the game. You can pick
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:10.240]   consonants and you can pick R and L and you will be tested to see how well you do on discriminating
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:19.200]   between the R and the L sound in listening tasks. And this is one of the first steps, I think,
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.600]   is being able to hear the difference because once you can hear the difference clearly,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:30.160]   then you'll be able to notice when you make mistakes in your pronunciation. And this is one
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:37.440]   of the things driving me crazy right now in my own Korean is I perceive differences in sounds.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:44.800]   But I still can't nail and accurately produce some sounds. And I can hear that it's bad,
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:50.480]   which drives me nuts. I'm like, Oh, I know this is wrong. But I'm also happy because I know this
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:56.480]   is the first step moving in the right direction towards clearer pronunciation. So yeah, guys,
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:02.480]   check out that website. I've used it before with my students and it's fantastic, the English accent
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:18.880]   coach. Awesome, Sue. Thank you for this lesson here today. I think all of our listeners will find
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:24.960]   it very helpful. And guys, just before we go, we'll remind you one more time about the study guide
