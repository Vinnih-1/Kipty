[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.320]   Sir Charles Warren, Chief of the Metropolitan Police Force, has decided to employ Bloodhounds
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.560]   in his efforts to discover the perpetrator of the White Chapel Murders.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.120]   The police placed confidence in the story of George M. Dodge, a seaman who states that
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.880]   in August last, he met a Malay cook named Alaska, with whom he had previously been acquainted
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.760]   on shipboard and a musical in London, and that Alaska told him he had been robbed of
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.200]   all he had by a woman of the town, and threatened that unless he found the woman and recovered
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.880]   his property, he would kill and mutilate every White Chapel woman he met.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.960]   The police are searching everywhere for the Malay.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.600]   Acting on information which has been furnished them, the police have seized and occupied
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.720]   several houses in that section.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.620]   This recording is in the public domain.
