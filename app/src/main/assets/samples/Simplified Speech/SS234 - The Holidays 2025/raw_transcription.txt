[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Hello, everybody, and welcome back to another simplified speech episode here at
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.080]   Qlips. For those of you who don't know, simplified speech is our series that
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.040]   features clear, natural, and easy to understand conversations between native
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.200]   speakers. Joining me today as my co-host is Indiana. Hello, Indiana. How are you
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.960]   doing today?
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.280]   I'm good, Andrew. Happy holidays.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.280]   Yeah, happy holidays. You'll still a little awkward for me to say that because I
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.400]   think we're like very, very early into the holiday season. In my opinion, Indiana,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.880]   we're recording this on December the second and listeners will probably hear
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.200]   it a few days later. So yeah, kind of early for me, but I guess it's that time
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.400]   of the year when we have to start saying it happy holidays. And guys, that's what
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.680]   we're going to talk about in this episode today is we are going to talk
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.080]   about the holiday season. So Indiana and people in the USA, they just
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.640]   celebrated Thanksgiving. So we're going to do a Thanksgiving recap and learn
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.120]   about how Indiana spent Thanksgiving. And then we're going to shift to Christmas
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.280]   and talk about how we're preparing for the upcoming Christmas and holiday
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.720]   season and all of the things that we do to celebrate this holiday. And I have to
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.520]   give a shout out to one of our awesome Q loops members, Adityka, who requested
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.920]   this topic. So thank you so much, Adityka for this great suggestion. And

[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.640]   about it. Turkey time, did you eat turkey for Thanksgiving?
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.960]   I did not. So that you're right to ask about Turkey, because that is
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.480]   traditional for Thanksgiving in the United States. That's like the standard
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.400]   main dish for your Thanksgiving feast. But my husband and I and my parents in
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.040]   law are vegetarians. So we skipped Turkey. There was no meat at our Thanksgiving
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.400]   dinner. Instead, for a couple of mains, we had lentil stuff squash and some
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.160]   corn chowder and an egg and onion tart. So and cheese wasn't that too. So for a
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.080]   little protein there. But it was it was we had a lot of other food. And although
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.640]   there was no turkey, there was plenty of food. And what we did at my house, I
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.720]   actually hosted Thanksgiving this year, which was really fun. But we did a potluck
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.400]   style Thanksgiving. And so a potluck is where every guest brings something to
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.000]   share, whether it's like a drink or a dessert or a dish for for the dinner. And
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.840]   then the the stress and the burden of creating a massive feast for all of
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.880]   your family is a lot less, yeah, a lot easier to manage. So I really like
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.440]   potluck style parties. And yeah, that's what we did this year. It was a lot of
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.320]   fun. It was good.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.000]   Nice. How many people did you host for the potluck?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.640]   I was supposed to be seven, my parents in law, my brother in law, and then my
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.520]   mom and my stepdad. But unfortunately, my mother-in-law got a cold, like at the
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.040]   last minute, and she stayed home. So it was just six of us, which was actually the
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.160]   perfect size for my dining room. So it was okay. But we missed having my mother-in-law
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.760]   there. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I agree. The potluck is a great way to do it because
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.680]   the burden of doing all of the cooking and the burden, yes, of doing all of the
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   dishes, I don't know. Did you still have to do all of the dishes? I kind of insist,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.600]   usually, when I have people over, like, I would rather have space in my kitchen and
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.880]   just like do the cleaning really quickly and let everybody else hang out. Not just
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.360]   to be a nice host, but like, there's this expression in English. Too many cooks in
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.040]   the kitchen are just too many cooks. And that basically means when there's too
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.640]   many people helping, it can actually become less helpful in the long run. So
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.200]   like somebody will say, "Hey, where does this dish go? Where does this plate go?
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.360]   Where do I put this?" And then I'm instead of actually cleaning, I'm
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.960]   answering questions. And then if somebody puts something in the wrong place, that's
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.000]   like, you know, it's just easier to have one person, maybe two people. Yeah, too
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.320]   many cooks. So I'm kind of like, "Get out of my kitchen. I'll clean." Yeah. Yeah, it's
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.160]   always awkward when you're a guest, right? You want to help. You don't want to
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.240]   just like sit there and relax while the host is doing all the work. But at the
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.200]   same time, when you're in somebody's kitchen, you don't know where all of the
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.400]   dishes go and how their kitchen is organized, then it can be like very
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.800]   difficult to actually be helpful. And you are more of just like a pain in the
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.760]   neck. Yeah, and like when I go to my parents-in-laws house and I like try to
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.080]   put things away in the dishwasher to help, I notice that my father-in-law
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   sometimes like kind of sneakily rearranges all of the dishes that I put
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.960]   away in the dishwasher because it's not like his system or the most efficient
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.600]   way. So I might as well just not do it. Yeah. Yeah, cool. What about some of the
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.360]   other big Thanksgiving traditions that are popular in the USA? I wanted to just
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.560]   throw a couple by you and maybe you could comment on them quickly. The first one
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.660]   that I remember, sometimes I would even watch it growing up in Canada. It would
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.640]   be on TV in Canada is the Thanksgiving Day Parade. Is that still a big thing?
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:37.000]   Yeah, I well I guess I don't have cable but everything's on streaming. Like I
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.360]   usually used to watch that every year. I don't know when I stopped but it's
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.640]   definitely still a thing and I think yeah, pretty common to just have it on in
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.120]   the background while you're cooking or getting ready for dinner. That and there's
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:57.000]   a dog show which is hosted I think by a guy who was on Seinfeld. I forget his
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.600]   name but he's like a pretty famous guy. He has a unique voice and they always have
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.800]   a dog show and the Macy's Day Parade. I think those are definitely still very
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.200]   watched by many heavily watched by people in the US. Yeah. Yeah, the Macy's
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.320]   Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City right and Macy's is the big department
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.080]   store brand that sponsors the parade and it's kind of like the kickoff to the
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.480]   Christmas season. You see all these different floats and a float is like the
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:33.000]   name of the display that goes down the road in the parade right and there are
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.880]   lots of different colorful ones and I think the last one is the Santa if I
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.640]   remember correctly and so Santa is kind of like welcoming in Christmas and so
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.360]   yeah, that is the parade and then I also think of football on Thanksgiving. I
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.880]   imagine that a lot of families tune in and watch football but I have a feeling
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.240]   maybe you're not a football watcher. Do you tune in to watch the Thanksgiving
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.000]   Day football game? I can't even remember the last time I watched the Super Bowl
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.960]   so no I definitely don't watch football on Thanksgiving. Not a sports girl but
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.200]   yeah you're right I mean I feel bad for them well not really because they're
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.320]   making millions of dollars but I feel bad for the football players who have to
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.640]   play on Thanksgiving. Sure yeah yeah a lot of them do actually end up having to
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.880]   work on the holidays right on Thanksgiving and Christmas but I would do it too
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.840]   for that amount of money. Don't get me wrong I'd be there. Another sports related
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.080]   one that I think about on Thanksgiving is actually related to running and so
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.520]   maybe I know you are a runner as well so maybe you know about this one that is
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.440]   the turkey trot. What is the turkey trot? Do you know about this? Yeah I I've never
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.440]   participated in one but it's really common in the U.S. or maybe it's also
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.560]   well no I wouldn't be in Canada. You guys have Thanksgiving in Canada right but
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.600]   it's a different day and it's like kind of different vibes right? Sorry to
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.760]   completely derail your topic but yeah does it exist in Canada? Yeah yeah we
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.240]   have Thanksgiving except it varies from year to year so it's not a fixed day and
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.960]   this year it was way back in early October if I recall correctly and it's
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.880]   kind of weird we celebrate it exactly the same way as American Thanksgiving same
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:32.320]   traditional food same like family oriented holiday we also watch football
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.400]   on Thanksgiving my dad always has the football game the CFL the Canadian
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.280]   Football League and so I think it's really the same but there is a little bit
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:47.120]   different historical origin and yeah a slightly different background to the
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.280]   holiday but yeah we finished our Thanksgiving way back in October. So maybe
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.320]   you guys have the turkey trot too but yeah there's it's like a local race
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:03.320]   basically yeah and maybe it's a 5k race something not too crazy long but yeah
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   I've never participated in one but those are definitely really popular I see a lot
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:14.080]   of Instagram posts from friends who participate in them on Thanksgiving. Yeah
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.800]   yeah the turkey trot just like a friendly 5k race I think and a lot of people like
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.560]   to maybe do some exercise on the day because they know they're going to be
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.800]   pigging out and eating a lot that evening right so I think maybe that's
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.040]   why people do it it's like get some exercise in the morning with this run
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.840]   and yeah because everybody's not working because of the holiday then you get
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.600]   lots of people participating and then later on you can go and eat your
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.520]   Thanksgiving meal and yeah not feel as guilty about eating a lot of food. Okay
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.960]   Indiana why don't we shift to Christmas and talk about the Christmas season
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:11:00.720]   here and I'm wondering in your mind when do you think of as the official start
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.920]   of the Christmas season when does it start for you? I get in the Christmas
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.640]   spirit or more in the mood for the holiday like I'm I'm feeling like it
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:20.040]   started maybe around the 20th the 21st like the week of Christmas is when I
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.360]   really feel like excited about it and ready to listen to Christmas carols but
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.920]   practically I think the second Thanksgiving is over the Christmas
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.040]   carols and jingles start playing in the supermarket and everybody starts putting
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.840]   up their holiday lights and decorations and so it's kind of unavoidable as soon
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.800]   as December starts so that is also why I said happy holidays because whether I
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:52.760]   agree with it we are kind of at least in the US in that season yeah. Okay yeah
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:59.720]   we're exactly on the same page because I agree I think it's spread out too long
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:05.480]   like I would love it if it was just the week of Christmas like I don't know
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.600]   Christmas is on December 25th so maybe we started decorating the house and
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.480]   playing Christmas carols and getting Christmassy around like December 18th
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.680]   19th something like that would be perfect and then yeah it's just like this
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:26.200]   really special unique time of the year however now it's so long like here in
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.720]   Seoul I know exactly the day because I ran a marathon on November 2nd and on
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.640]   November 1st the day before the marathon my friend and I went to this marathon
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:43.300]   pop-up event that was in one of the big department stores here in Seoul so that
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:50.800]   was November 1st the day after Halloween and we went to the department store it
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.120]   was all decked out for Christmas big Christmas trees Christmas lights everywhere
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.040]   Christmas music playing all I want for Christmas is you playing on repeat
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:06.920]   already on November 1st so that's like almost a full two months before Christmas
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.680]   and I was just losing my mind I was like this is too much I can't handle it it's
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.960]   too long why is it so long I don't get it that is so interesting because I I
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:23.080]   figured that was maybe not uniquely American but like if I think of the
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.020]   United States I think of like consumerism and heavy on the you know okay we're
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.760]   gonna push the product in the supermarket as soon as we can you know or
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:36.880]   the department store so here I am used to that I get that vibe but in Korea
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:42.600]   too so in Seoul like on the November 1st so do yeah I'm curious Andrew how
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:49.120]   extensively is Christmas celebrated in Korea or like what kinds of decorations
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.160]   do you see or like yeah I wouldn't expect it to be so such a big thing but yeah
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:01.200]   tell me about it in Seoul yeah I would say that in terms of like looking
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.320]   Christmas-y it's almost the same as North America there are Christmas trees
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.560]   everywhere now people don't put up Christmas lights outside of their home
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.280]   because most people live in big apartment towers so it's kind of
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.440]   impractical however like in my neighborhood there's a big
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.520]   intersection and at the intersection there's a big Christmas tree that's there
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.040]   so it's like right in the middle of the neighborhood this big Christmas tree
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.680]   with lots of beautiful lights and if you go down into the subway stations a lot
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.120]   of the subway stations have Christmas lights and are decorated and now I
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.120]   think sometimes these are sponsored by local churches so a church will like
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.620]   put up a Christmas tree and I don't know if they just want to decorate it in the
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:52.080]   subway station says sure do it but stores are really Christmas-y I was
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.920]   walking around a neighborhood in downtown Seoul the other night with my
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:02.200]   wife and almost every little restaurant or cafe that we passed by had a Christmas
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.680]   tree and Christmas lights and actually felt really Christmas-y it was almost I
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.120]   felt like I was in like Sweden or something I was like here we are in Seoul
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.440]   what it felt like this really Christmas vibe it was actually pretty nice so I
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:22.880]   would say yes absolutely visually it's everywhere you can't really avoid it at
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.920]   least in the downtown part of Seoul maybe some countryside places are not not as
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.600]   much but yeah here in the city definitely and even it was my father-in-law's
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.480]   birthday celebration the other day so my wife's side of the family we all got
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.800]   together and we celebrated his birthday at a restaurant and I was complaining to
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.120]   my wife after I'm like oh so annoying that they were playing Christmas music
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.560]   the whole time because in the background they had like Christmas music not not
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.840]   singing and not carols but just instrumental like piano like you know
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:07.080]   that light jazzy Christmas-y background music yes and actually I asked my wife
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.240]   I was like did you pick up that those were all classic Christmas tunes that
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.200]   they were playing the whole time and she's like no I didn't even notice so I
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:20.000]   think for a lot of maybe Korean people they don't know about that like they
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.280]   maybe didn't grow up listening to all of the Christmas carols and Christmas
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.880]   music so my wife or maybe my wife just didn't even register maybe she wasn't
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.520]   listening to the background music but for me because I'm a Grinch and because I
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.360]   think the Christmas season is too long I was like a little frustrated I was like
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.800]   why do they have to play all this Christmas music still November at that
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.120]   time in the background while we're eating dinner so yeah just goes to show that
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.760]   Christmas really is everywhere here in in Seoul at least wow well I learned
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.720]   something new today I would not have expected that yeah yeah it is a public
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.880]   holiday here as well I know in other Asian countries like Japan and like
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.560]   China I think people do celebrate to an extent in those places and guys if
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.240]   you're listening in Japan or China or other Asian countries maybe you can chime
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:15.320]   in and let us know what it's like at home for you but I think yeah here in
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.200]   Seoul it actually is a public holiday and people do take the day off and I don't
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.480]   know how each individual celebrates maybe some people are really really into it
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.240]   and some people couldn't be bothered at all and it's just like a free holiday
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   for them score but yeah it is a day off is a public holiday so that's nice nice
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:44.660]   for me at least so okay you don't like to decorate your home until maybe the
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.160]   week before Christmas do you do anything to like decorate your home do you put up
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.240]   a Christmas tree do you have any Christmas lights anything like that no I
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:59.080]   really don't and part of it is like kind of laziness cuz I don't I don't like I
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.160]   don't know it takes a long time to set up a really nice light display and to
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:10.640]   like neatly wrap them around like shrubs or bushes around your doorframe so
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   there's that aspect of it I think just a little bit of laziness but also my
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:20.080]   husband is Jewish and does not really celebrate Christmas so there's no sort
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.000]   of push or excitement from him to do that kind of thing either so yeah we
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.760]   really don't decorate or anything like that but yeah one thing I do like to do
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:35.160]   though is make Christmas cookies I usually do that sometime around the week
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.640]   of Christmas maybe before or after sometimes I do that with my mom sometimes
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.800]   just alone but there's some traditional ones that are common in the US that I
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.880]   like to make there's a kind called snowball cookies so they look like little
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.160]   snowballs it's like a cookie made of ground walnuts or almonds and flour and
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.200]   a lot of butter and then you roll them twice after you bake them they're ball
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   shaped and you roll them in confectioners sugar powdered sugar and those are just
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:12.880]   great like they're really good and they're clearly you know festive in the sense
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.280]   that they look like snow and it's winter time so those are cute and another one
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.320]   I really like to make is peanut butter blossoms so it's like a peanut butter
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.880]   cookie that you stick a Hershey's kiss in the center of and then you put it back
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.120]   in the oven for a second and it kind of melts just a little bit and gets soft
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.000]   and that's like another really great cookie there's a bunch of classic ones
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.680]   but I think those are usually staples of mine I usually try to make those every
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:46.400]   year well well longtime queue lips listeners will know that my favorite
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:53.160]   food is peanuts and peanut butter so that second cookie caught my attention I
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.080]   would love to try that that sounds delicious have you never had one have
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:03.280]   you have you had or seen them before I don't think I've had one to be honest I'm
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   trying to think of like my mom's classic baking Christmas baking because my mom
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.800]   would always bake up a storm when I was younger and she still does but I'm just
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.520]   not home to take advantage of all the baking but my mom would make date
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:24.280]   squares I don't know if you know what a date square is I can imagine it maybe but
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:30.920]   no I've never heard of that it's almost like you use a baking pan almost like a
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:36.120]   casserole dish some some longer pan with some depth to it maybe you could think
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.320]   of brownies it's kind of the same as brownies and then so you make this big
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:46.480]   pan desserts and date squares it's like you have this crumbly almost granola on
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.360]   the bottom and then in the middle you have dates like that dried fruit and then
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.400]   on the top you have another crumbly kind of granola and then you'd bake that and
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.640]   then cut it into little squares and yeah date squares those were always
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:07.440]   delicious hmm what else would she make Nanaimo bars this is a very Canadian
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.760]   dessert I'm sure you probably have never tried a Nanaimo bar do you know what
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.680]   that is at all you know what I went back one time into the Kulep's archive and
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.920]   I listened to an episode that you did where you mentioned Nanaimo bars so I
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:27.160]   have heard of them but that was the only time in my life Wow but yeah I've
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.360]   I've quickly forgotten so please remind me what exactly the ingredients are
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:38.240]   yeah and a Nanaimo bar is it's like chocolate on the top again it's cut into
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:44.040]   a square guys so it's like think about a size of a brownie again and yeah
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   chocolate on top and there's some kind of yellow sweet filling in the middle I
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.840]   think it's a kind of custard and then sometimes it's been a while since I've
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.320]   had one they were never my favorite because they're so sweet it's a very
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.800]   sweet dessert and I'm not a big sweet kind of guy so I can't say exactly but
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:10.160]   an Nanaimo bar my mom would make and then also she would make like cookies as
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.960]   well Christmas cookies various different types maybe gingerbread is a classic
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:24.200]   Christmas cookie and also she would make this dessert called almond roka which is
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.080]   like this brittle candy made with almonds almond roka and chocolate on the top
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:34.320]   with some peanuts very good so my mom would always yeah bake up a storm and I
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.600]   haven't carried that tradition on at all I don't think I do any Christmas
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.960]   baking at all unfortunately but maybe I will this year maybe I'll get that
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.840]   recipe for the what were they called the peanut butter drops is that what you
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:54.360]   call them peanut butter blossoms I I looked them up before recording because I
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.640]   wanted to check that that like I didn't just make up a name for them and yes
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.480]   that's like what most of the recipes call them peanut butter blossoms yeah peanut
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:13.000]   butter blossoms okay Indiana do you have a favorite Christmas song oh that's a
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.520]   great question because there's so many awful Christmas songs that you never
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:24.320]   want to hear again at least I I feel that way oh that's a great question
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:30.120]   honestly because I love David Bowie I feel like his rendition of Little Drummer
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.440]   Boy which he did oh gosh that's embarrassing that I can't remember the
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.160]   name of the other guy burl-ives maybe maybe oh but no I don't think it was
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.960]   burl-ives but somebody like that yeah I'm sure if listeners are interested they
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.240]   also like David Bowie just look up David Bowie Little Drummer Boy it's a cool
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:57.680]   song it's a duo yeah let me do it right now Little Drummer Boy I'm curious as
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:03.120]   well who is it a Bing Crosby Bing Crosby yes because he does a lot of
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.040]   Christmas songs yeah it's a it's and there's a video of them and it's very
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:15.880]   kind of I don't know if it's what's a good word for it it's an it seems a
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:23.480]   little mmm stiff or it's I don't know there's a bit an interesting vibe between
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.200]   David Bowie and Ben Crosby in the video it's worth a watch it's a it's a good
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:35.920]   classic song okay Bing Crosby and burl-ives and David Bowie yeah yeah oh
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.600]   sorry yeah Bing Crosby and David Bowie not but why do I have burl-ives in my
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.360]   head burl-ives guys is like this old old-time American singer and I think he
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.360]   did like some famous Christmas records so yes I think so yeah that's why he
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:56.280]   popped into my my mind I was thinking Indiana and maybe I'd like to get your
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.320]   opinion on this because I know you're a music person but I would contend I would
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:07.160]   argue that there hasn't been a good Christmas song written for at least like
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:13.500]   25 30 years I want to say that the last good Christmas song is probably Mariah
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.840]   Kerry all I want for Christmas is you which unfortunately has been killed
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:23.100]   because it's been overplayed so so much that I think it's a really good song but
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.600]   it was just overplayed to an extreme amount so that yeah it's difficult to
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.640]   listen to these days but since then I don't think there's been really any good
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.840]   Christmas songs which is unfortunate because in the 80s we had like David
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:44.120]   Bowie and Paul McCartney and all of these big massive pop stars writing these
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.080]   really catchy Christmas songs but now maybe I'm just not listening maybe like
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.600]   there are some great artists making Christmas music and it just hasn't
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.320]   become classic yet I'm not sure but what do you think about my argument would you
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.440]   agree or disagree I think you're probably right that there's not a lot of good
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:12.320]   new Christmas songs but I I did when I was a DJ at college and I was DJing for
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.160]   my college radio station I would do a Christmas show and I would try to find
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.560]   like alternative Christmas songs and there's a lot of artists that like you and
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.600]   I would both love or recognize who have covered many Christmas songs and it's
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.200]   refreshing to hear something that's not played like non-stop for the entire
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.320]   month of December on the radio so there's a lot of good covers out there by
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:40.520]   artists that are are good that maybe don't get a lot of airplay but I think you
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.120]   could be right that new fresh like completely original Christmas music
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.280]   there's not a lot of it I think Sophia and so John Stevens I actually don't know
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.720]   how you pronounce his name but he might have made a Christmas album or like has
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.240]   his own Christmas music so he could be an exception but no I think you're right
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:05.080]   it's there's not a lot of original Christmas stuff that's very good I don't
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.760]   think so yeah yeah hmm I don't know stuff Jan Stevens I also don't know how to
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:18.000]   pronounce his name but it's S U F J A N I believe is the spelling of his first
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.920]   name so some people say S U F J A N some people say S U F J A N kind of a more like
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.560]   European way I'm not sure how to pronounce it but a very interesting
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.720]   American songwriter who's created a lot of classic indie albums and I could
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:39.120]   imagine his music is very magical sounding a lot of times so that would be a great
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.720]   fit for him to write some Christmas music so I'll check that one out yeah I
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.840]   think he has if if not in a whole album I think there are at least a few songs
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:52.800]   yeah okay cool all right so Indiana the last thing we'll talk about here maybe
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.240]   is the cherry on top the creme de la creme and that is gift giving which is a
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:05.920]   big part of of Christmas and also for me maybe the most stressful part and I
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:11.000]   get stressed out for a couple of reasons first is I have people in my life
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.080]   asking me what do you want what do you want for Christmas my parents will ask
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.720]   me my wife will ask me and my answer is always like nothing I don't need anything
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.280]   I'm good I'm okay however people hate to hear that answer because they want to
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.320]   give something right it's like a Christmas is about showing your love and
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:36.320]   affection and care through a present and giving somebody something that they need
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.480]   but I really feel like I don't technically need anything my life is
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.280]   pretty comfortable which is great and so yeah I always say like oh you don't have
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.760]   to buy me anything don't worry about it but they don't like that so that causes
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.560]   me stress I have to think of something that I don't probably really need but
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.240]   then at the same time I'm also in that similar situation where I want to buy
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:04.200]   gifts for my family and buy a gift for my wife and that always is difficult too
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.080]   because when I think about it I'm like my wife technically doesn't really need
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.440]   anything you know so it's like it's tough I don't know maybe because of your
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.960]   husband not celebrating Christmas maybe it's easy for you do you guys exchange
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.560]   gifts at all does he buy you a gift for Christmas at all you know we used to do
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.160]   that but not in the past few years so yeah it's pretty easy for me I just have
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.360]   to worry about my mom and my stepdad for Christmas we have like the smallest
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.720]   Christmas ever so the gift giving although it's still stressful I completely
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.360]   understand everything that you've said you know like I hate coming up with a
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.960]   list of things I want it feels like selfish and like also if I really want
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.840]   something and I know like the right thing that I want I can just save up and buy
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.520]   it myself you know but but it is really nice to exchange gifts or have some sort
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:02.800]   of surprise so I also yeah I have mixed feelings about it too but if anything
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.520]   that I would say to make it easier I would say like consumables something that
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.160]   you can use and then not not keep forever like some really nice coffee or like a
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.200]   sugar scrub for like the bath or something like those kinds of things I
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.160]   feel like pretty good about asking for or giving because you know they're not
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.520]   gonna be cluttering up somebody's house forever and yeah I don't know
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.080]   something you could eat or put on your body like that I think is kind of a
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:37.160]   safe gift that yeah it'll it'll go away eventually yeah that's a great idea
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:42.680]   yeah that's very good this year my wife and I have decided just to do a simple
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.760]   gift exchange and not go all out and spend like a lot of money and be very
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:54.120]   elaborate anything like that so we've set a budget of around 20 dollars 20
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:00.040]   American dollars which oh is like pretty low right that is low yeah we've we've
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:06.800]   decided just to keep it very low key this year and so now I at first when my wife
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.480]   suggested this I was like yeah let's do it and now I'm already feeling a little
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:16.280]   bit stressed like what should I buy her I don't know because it's not a lot of
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.360]   money but yeah I guess I could buy something like what you just mentioned
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:28.520]   like probably a bath bomb or you know a bag of coffee or something but does that
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.720]   really show like a lot of care and love for a husband to a wife I'm not sure so
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:38.200]   guys I'm stressed out about this and if you have any great ideas about something
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.320]   you think that I could give her I'm all ears I'm open to your suggestions let me
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.920]   know what you think would make a great $20 or under Christmas gift maybe I was
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:54.120]   thinking like a lot of little mini things maybe if I could find five or six
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.100]   small things maybe I'll have to go to the dollar store I'm not sure but it could
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:03.400]   be more fun to open like several different little gifts than one kind of
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:09.720]   small one or maybe like a used book or used record I'm not sure I just did a
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:15.560]   scavenger hunt for my husband's birthday with I ordered a bunch of German
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.480]   licorice that is you can't really buy in the United States so I ordered it from
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:25.760]   Europe and I hid them all over the house and like made cryptic clues for him to
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.640]   find them so that could add a layer at no cost for a bunch of tiny gifts if if
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:39.160]   you feel creative in that way I love that idea the scavenger hunt that would be
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:45.680]   fun also one of my favorite things growing up as a kid was the Christmas
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.240]   stocking Christmas stocking so that would be like yeah the classic gift from Santa
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:57.220]   Claus with this big like sock right that's like usually doesn't look like a sock
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:04.880]   though it's like this really beautifully knit large sock shaped stocking and in
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.040]   the Christmas stocking there would be lots of different candy and like little
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:13.240]   gifts little mini things which was always really fun to open and my parents
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:18.040]   always insisted that was the first thing that my siblings and I open so that was
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.880]   always like the kickoff to the Christmas Day gift celebration and I always really
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.880]   love that so maybe I'll prepare a Christmas stocking that could be fun for
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:33.080]   my wife that's a great idea yeah yeah I like that okay well Indiana I think we've
