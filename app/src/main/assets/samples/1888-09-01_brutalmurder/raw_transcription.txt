[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.200]   Murder in White Chapel from our own correspondent. London, August 31. A strangely horrible murder
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.240]   took place at White Chapel this morning. The victim was a woman who at three o'clock was
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.880]   knocked down by some man unknown and attacked with a knife. She attempted to escape and ran
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.720]   a hundred yards. Her cries for help being heard by several persons and adjacent houses. No
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.480]   attention was paid to her cries, however, and when found at daybreak she was lying dead
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.040]   in another street several hundred yards from the scene of the attack. Her head was nearly
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.640]   severed from her body, which was literally cut to pieces, one gash reaching from the pelvis
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.800]   to the breastbone. The strangest part of the affair is that this is the third murder of
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.480]   the kind which has been done lately. In the last one two weeks ago the victim was stabbed
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.480]   39 times. In the case before some months ago the victim was stabbed with a stick which was
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.000]   forced through the body. All three victims have been women of the lowest class. All three
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.360]   murders have taken place in the same district at about the same hour and have been characterized
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.280]   by the same inhuman and ghoul-like brutality. The police have concluded that the same man
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.000]   did all three murders and that the most dangerous kind of lunatic is at large. The excitement
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.640]   is intense over the matter and the women in White Chapel are afraid to stir out of their
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.680]   doors unprotected after dark. End of article. This recording is in the public domain.
