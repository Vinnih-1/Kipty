[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.560]   - Hey everybody, my name is Andrew.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.020]   - And I'm Suzanne.
[00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.480]   - And you're listening to Q-Lips.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.720]   - Hey there Suzanne.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.160]   - Hey Andrew, how's it going?
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.360]   - Oh not too bad, how about yourself?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.400]   - Pretty good, except I went to the gym two days ago
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.840]   for the first time in like three weeks.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.480]   And it felt like it was the first time
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.480]   I'd ever worked out in my whole life.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.520]   And I'm actually having trouble walking.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.280]   My legs hurt so much that I actually couldn't get down
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.120]   the stairs to go grocery shopping yesterday.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.160]   - Oh my, that sounds like maybe you overdid it.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.880]   - I guess so, but I didn't even do so much.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   It was really just the fact that I didn't work out
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360]   for a while and I think I'm kind of out of shape.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.680]   So I think it kicked my butt a bit.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.560]   - Well, I'm sure you'll get back into the swing of things
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.560]   after just a couple more days and feel good again soon.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.640]   - Yeah, I hope so, 'cause walking, it's important, you know?
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.000]   - Super important, absolutely.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.440]   - Yeah.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   - Suzanne, today we are back with a Speak Easy episode.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.200]   And I love the Speak Easy series
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   because it's where you teach us, me and all of the listeners,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.760]   some interesting and very important pronunciation rules
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.000]   to help our pronunciation sound more natural
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.520]   and more understandable.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.640]   - Yeah, I'm glad you like it.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.800]   - Yeah, of course, it's very fun.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.640]   So what are we covering today in this episode?
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   - So today, we're covering one simple aspect
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.040]   of the larger idea of word stress.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.640]   And we're looking at the kind of stress
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   that is in a word that has two or more syllables.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.880]   So some words in English
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.560]   that instead of having just one syllable like walk or work,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.640]   we know that has one syllable,
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.400]   so we stress that whole word.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   But if the word has two or more syllables
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.480]   like walking or working,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.200]   we have one syllable that's stressed or emphasized more
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.360]   than the other one.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.160]   Now, it can get a little complicated
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   when there are three, four, five or six syllables in a word.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.560]   So today we're gonna look at where to stress
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.400]   in a word that ends with I-O-N,
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.440]   which is a common ending in English.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.320]   - Absolutely, a very common ending
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.080]   for many nouns in English.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.240]   And I think, you know, Suzanne,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.880]   if you speak a romance language,
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.440]   you'll probably have words in your language
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.640]   that end with the same ending,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.220]   but I believe the stress is different.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.440]   - It is, and the pronunciation of the I-O-N ending
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.520]   is also different.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.960]   So before we actually look at the stress,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.360]   we should just kind of quickly cover
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.520]   how to pronounce that ending.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.360]   - Yeah.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.920]   - Because I think, for example, in French,
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.800]   we might say (speaks in French)
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.080]   and we really pronounce the I-O-N.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.080]   And maybe in Italian, you might say (speaks in French)
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.440]   - I don't speak any Italian, Suzanne.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.120]   I'm sorry, it can't help you there.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.560]   - I'm super rusty.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.800]   - But many times in romance languages,
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.000]   the I-O-N is actually pronounced,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.640]   making it a two-syllable interaction like (speaks in French)
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.440]   However, in English, you're going to make it
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.240]   one short, simple sound,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.760]   and it is the common (speaks in French)
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.640]   sound like in the.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.760]   And it is what we call a schwa, actually.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   This is a schwa vowel in phonetics,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.080]   and it's the most common vowel sound in English.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.600]   We're going to do another podcast on just the schwa,
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.560]   so we'll talk about that another time in more detail,
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.400]   but I just wanted to make sure that people knew,
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.760]   since we're focusing on I-O-N words,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.680]   that they know that it's just like (speaks in French)
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.520]   - Yes.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.680]   - (speaks in French)
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.800]   - To put it in the context of a word,
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   a word like communication, right?
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.640]   - Shin.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.200]   - Communication.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.560]   - Shin, mm-hmm.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.560]   And in fact, some people you'll notice,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.800]   if you listen to many different speakers of English,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.040]   you may notice that in North America,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.280]   we actually sometimes use an I, like as in sit,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   and we might even say communication, shin, so.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.560]   - Shin, yeah, shin, shin.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.080]   - Shin or shin, both are correct, mm-hmm.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.520]   - Yeah, yeah, good point.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.600]   - Yeah.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.320]   So now we're gonna listen to an example dialogue,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.040]   and it's kind of a lengthy dialogue,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.680]   and I want us to see if we can start to pick up
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.320]   the patterns of where the stress would be
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.840]   in I-O-N-ending words.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.240]   So let's see if we can start to hear a pattern,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.160]   and guess what the rule is for this kind of word.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.280]   All right, so everybody, listen for these words
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.880]   that end with I-O-N, shin, ending,
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.360]   and see if you can identify where the stress is placed
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.200]   in that word while you're listening to this dialogue.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.560]   Okay, let's take a listen to it now.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.440]   (keyboard clicking)
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.960]   Hey, Kate, did you finish the communications homework?
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.640]   - No, not yet.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.800]   I had to finish my application
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.200]   and get started on collecting my thesis information.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.120]   Was it hard?
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.680]   - Well, after spending two hours on the same essay,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.400]   I certainly had some frustration.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.840]   What was the application you were working on?
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.080]   - Oh, it's for this not-for-profit organization
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.680]   that I wanna work for, for my internship.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.640]   - Oh, cool.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.120]   Do they ask for any certifications?
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.400]   I know I have to renew some of mine.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.360]   - No, no certifications at the moment,
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.960]   but I have to make a presentation
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.680]   of my experience with other corporations.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.880]   Like I have time for more work.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.720]   - Good luck.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.800]   (keyboard clicking)
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.960]   - Okay, that was great, Suzanne.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.280]   I think now let's listen to it one more time,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.000]   but at a slightly slowed down pace.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.320]   The first time we listened to it,
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.640]   that was full native speaker speaking speed,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.000]   but now let's listen to it one more time
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.440]   at a slower pace.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   Does that sound okay to you?
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.720]   - Yeah, sounds good.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.880]   - Okay, here we go.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.240]   (keyboard clicking)
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.160]   Hey, Kate, did you finish the communications homework?
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.120]   - No, not yet.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.840]   I had to finish my application
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.680]   and get started on collecting my thesis information.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.600]   Was it hard?
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.600]   - Well, after spending two hours on the same essay,
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.120]   I certainly had some frustration.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.920]   What was the application you were working on?
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.200]   - Oh, it's for this not-for-profit organization
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.480]   that I want to work for for my internship.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.760]   - Oh, cool.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.360]   Do they ask for any certifications?
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.800]   I know I have to renew some of mine.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.160]   - No, no certifications at the moment,
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.920]   but I have to make a presentation of my experience
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.440]   with other corporations.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.660]   Like I have time for more work.
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.440]   - Good luck.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.800]   - So, Andrew, now let's look at some of the words
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.360]   that we heard, the I-O-N words.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.760]   What words did you hear in that dialogue?
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.120]   - Whew, that was a gold mine of words
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.160]   that end with the shin ending, Suzanne, good job,
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.800]   making up that dialogue.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   Well, let's see, there was communications, application,
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.840]   certification, frustration, organization,
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.960]   corporation, presentation, wow,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.800]   lots and lots of shin words there.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.680]   - Totally.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.400]   So, what did you notice in,
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.800]   since you were pronouncing all of those words,
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.280]   what did you notice about where the stress was
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.480]   in those I-O-N words?
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.240]   - All right, well, let's repeat one of the words again.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.680]   Let's use frustration, frustration, frustration.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.040]   - So, the stress seems to be on that A sound,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.760]   frustration, frustration, frustration.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.200]   - Exactly, exactly, let's try another one.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.920]   So, maybe like application.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.800]   - Application, A, A, application.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   - Yes.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.360]   - Again, on that A vowel sound that comes
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.320]   in the middle of the word towards the end,
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.260]   maybe the applique, so the third syllable.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.560]   - Exactly.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.200]   - So, if you think about it,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   that's the syllable, that's right before the I-O-N ending.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.160]   Right?
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.760]   If we add the I-O-N to the word, or T-I-O-N,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.280]   or S-I-O-N, as it's sometimes spelled,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.160]   we can then ding, ding, ding, make up a rule,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.760]   saying that when we have an I-O-N ending,
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.400]   the stress in the word or the emphasis is going to go
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   to the syllable that comes right before the I-O-N ending,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   which is usually the second to the last syllable of the word.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.800]   So, if we sound out k, mu, n, k, shun,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:15.040]   we have five syllables, and the k is our second
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.240]   to the last syllable because the I-O-N ending to that word
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:27.080]   makes that A, the syllable that we emphasize, right?
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.400]   Communication.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.440]   - Very, very cool.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   So, simply, all we have to do is stress the syllable
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.720]   before the I-O-N ending.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.800]   - Yeah.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.360]   - Wow, I love that.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.800]   - That's your quick and dirty tip.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.440]   - You know, English, as our listeners know,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.280]   has so many exceptions to the rule
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.000]   that it's really refreshing and nice
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.160]   when you can learn something that's as straightforward
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.240]   as this rule is.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.880]   - Yes, and as we'll find out as we dive deeper and deeper
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.000]   into word stress, there will be many other exceptions,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.360]   but in this case, it's nice and dependable.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.680]   Which is nice.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:36.000]   - Sue, thank you for sharing this pronunciation rule
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.280]   with us today.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.480]   - Of course, yeah, my pleasure.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.080]   We should let everybody know that there is a study guide
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.080]   for this episode available to all Q-Lips members
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.120]   to download from our website QLips.com.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.400]   So, Q-Lips members, you know that the study guide is there,

[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.120]   It has some practice exercises, some audio exercises,

[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.480]   Yeah, if you're a Q-Lips member,
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.400]   you don't get the study guide just for this episode,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.440]   but for all of the episodes in our library.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.400]   So, it's a really great resource and an affordable resource.
