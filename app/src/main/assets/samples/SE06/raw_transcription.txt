[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.960]   Hey everybody, my name is Andrew and my name is Suzanne.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.760]   And you are listening to Speak Easy by Qillips.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:25.680]   Hey there, Suzanne.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.240]   Hey Andrew, how's it going?
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.820]   I'm doing very well, thanks.
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.160]   Sue, it's been a little while since our last Speak Easy episode, but we're back.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.680]   We are.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.400]   That's exciting.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.960]   Yeah, super exciting.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.360]   And today we have a short but sweet episode, and we're actually going to address a question
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.120]   that we got asked via Twitter.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.680]   And it's a pronunciation question.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.440]   And I know Suzanne, you're the pronunciation expert Qillips office.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.160]   So I thought I should defer to you.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.840]   I should ask you.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.760]   Sure, this is so exciting.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.400]   Okay, so we got a question from Summerile.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:30.760]   And they ask, "Hi Andrew, sometimes the L-E-S-S, or less at the end of a word, right,
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:40.720]   is pronounced 'I' like 'sit', sometimes it's pronounced 'uh' like 'the'.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.480]   What's the difference I'm wondering?
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.040]   So we have L-E-S-S, 'less' or 'less', right?
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.640]   Yeah, because the spelling is exactly the same with this suffix, right?
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.560]   L-E-S-S, but in some varieties of English, sometimes it's 'less'.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   And sometimes it's 'less'.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.320]   And so this Twitter user is wondering, "When do I say 'less', when do I say 'less'?
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.960]   That's a very good question.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.120]   And Suzanne, I will let you answer the question here in just a moment, but before we get to
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.280]   the answer, I want to remind everyone that there is a study guide for this episode available
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.880]   now on our website, qlips.com.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.960]   And actually, there are study guides for all of the episodes that we create and upload.

[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.360]   and your listening, fluency, your vocabulary, all of these necessary English skills, then
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.480]   you're going to want to study with our study guides.

[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.040]   Suzanne, what is the answer to the question?
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.840]   Duh-duh-duh-duh.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.240]   All right.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:37.120]   Well, in North America, we generally use 'less', the 'i' sound, as in 'sit'.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:46.160]   In place of the schwa, not all the time, but in most cases, we actually say 'i'.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:57.440]   So it's not only with 'l-e-s-s', it's with sometimes 't-i-o-n' or 's-i-o-n', for example,
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.160]   we might say 'communication', 'shin', instead of 'communication'.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.600]   Right, yeah.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.040]   So we generally use more of an 'i' sound.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:19.200]   Again, I'm going to reiterate that we don't always use the 'i', but it's more often used
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   in North America, especially when it's 'l-e-s-s', or 'n-e-s-s', right?
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.720]   Like 'kindness', right?
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.960]   We'll say 'kindness'.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   Kindness.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.360]   Instead of 'kind-n-us', 'kind-n-us', we don't say.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.760]   I would say 'kindness', 'smooth-ness', 'faithfulness', like this.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   Exactly.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:51.960]   So the two examples that 'summer-ile' gives us, 'effort-less' and 'cord-less'.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.680]   So those would both be 'is' if we were speaking English in North America.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:09.880]   Now, when we look at other varieties of English, such as in the UK, or in Australia, or New
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:20.680]   Zealand, or parts of South Africa, there will be a schwa used, like 'less', or 'nus',
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.360]   or 'shun'.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:37.020]   So you might hear people in the UK say 'communication', or 'cord-less', or 'while-less', or 'effort-less'.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:47.260]   So this is more widely used, the schwa, I should say, is more widely used in the UK
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.280]   varieties of English.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   It seems to me that the UK variety of English and Australian English, these other varieties,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.760]   they're sort of deeper in the throat, right, but that schwa vowel sounds like it's coming
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.680]   from deeper in your throat, if you say 'communication', or 'cord-less'.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.680]   It's true, it's true.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:22.000]   And when I say it, my voice lowers an octave.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.960]   Now, this isn't hard and fast-truth necessarily, it's partly my experience and speculation,
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:34.280]   but I think the reason why people in the UK use the 'uh' more often, and just like
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:42.200]   you said, Andrew, it sounds like it's further back in the mouth, is because when we teach
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:49.320]   say a British accent, we tell students to really open the back of their throat and sort of
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:56.720]   use the back vowels and the back of their tongue, or the mid part of their tongue, a
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.520]   bit more.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:04.560]   And so the vowels are a little bit more centered inside the mouth, whereas when we teach a North
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.680]   American accent, we tell people to have a higher and more forward tongue arch.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:20.800]   And this is because if you hear people on TV shows or commercials, you might hear a
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:29.840]   bit more of a forward, brighter, sometimes mistaken for nasal sound in someone's voice.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:37.000]   For example, if we spoke with like a sort of an estuary accent, which is like a common
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.800]   sound in London, like sorts of like this, it's really in the middle of my voice.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:50.160]   But if I speak like I'm from the US, which is where I'm from, you might hear this kind
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.280]   of forward, bright, really resonant in the front of my mouth, this kind of sound.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:08.680]   So this makes us think that when we're speaking in a UK English, we are pulling the vowels
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.880]   a little bit further toward the center and a is a central vowel.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:20.200]   And when we're speaking with a more North American accent, we are pulling the vowels
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:30.840]   a bit more forward, which is the I sound, the I is a more front and forward vowel.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:38.040]   I think that this might be why, but I don't have complete research on that yet.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.920]   Well, you've convinced me Suzanne, it sounds very believable to me.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:51.880]   And I think this is good news for anybody that's curious about this question because
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.160]   it's rather black and white, isn't it?
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.960]   It's really a dialect issue, an accent issue, and not one of those tricky issues where
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.640]   you have to learn a different pronunciation, depending on which word it is.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.560]   It's simply that if you're in North America speaking with the North American accent, and
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.520]   of course, we're talking about the broad popular North American accents.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.480]   There might be some smaller regional accents that differ, but the broad accent in North
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:31.520]   America, we say, lists like cordless and in other varieties of English, then you might
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.960]   hear less like cordless.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:42.000]   Yes, exactly, exactly, and it's important to know not just for you to make it, but for
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:58.080]   you to perceive it, so when you travel, you're not confused.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.000]   Thank you very much for your question, Summer Isle.
