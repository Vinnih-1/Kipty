[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Hello everybody, and welcome back to another brand new simplified speech episode here at Qloops.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.160]   Simplified speech is our series that features clear, natural, and easy to understand conversations
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.960]   about an interesting topic. And today we've got a good one for you, as always, a very interesting
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.160]   one. I think I'm really interested to see what my co-host is going to say about this topic today,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.120]   because yeah, it's going to be interesting to see the psychology of her thoughts and her opinions
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.520]   on this topic. Before I go on too much about her, though, I should introduce her to everyone. It's
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.280]   Indiana. Hey there, Indiana. How's it going? Hey, Andrew. Hey guys, how are you all doing today?
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.600]   Indiana, we're going to get inside your mind here for this episode because we're talking about
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.120]   ethical dilemmas, ethical dilemmas. And yeah, this is actually rather kind of a high level topic for
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.040]   simplified speech. So we should break it down and explain to our listeners here what we mean
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.720]   when we say ethical dilemmas. Do you want to do the honors and explain it to everyone?
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.800]   Sure. I would say that an ethical dilemma is a difficult decision that you're put in throughout
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.520]   life, you know, different life experiences, bring you into these challenges where you have to decide
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.760]   what the right thing, what the moral or ethical thing is to do. And it's not easy. It's a dilemma,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.720]   which is something where maybe there's two choices and both of them have some pros and cons. And it's
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.240]   a difficult to decide between the two of them. But ethical dilemmas, they're more centered on
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.840]   what do you think is the best, the most moral or right thing to do? So it calls to your sense of
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   justice or yeah, what you believe to be truly the right thing to do. Do you have any examples,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.680]   Andrew, of like what a common or an ethical dilemma that somebody might encounter in their life is?
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.760]   For example, imagine you are taking an exam and you looked over at your best friend who's in class
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.640]   with you, and you noticed that he's cheating. What do you do in that situation? Do you just ignore it
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.080]   and protect your best friend? Or do you tell the teacher and get your friend in trouble, but then
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.240]   keep the fairness of the exam for all students? That would be a dilemma, right? An ethical dilemma
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.880]   because we know cheating is wrong. But also we know that standing up for your friends and supporting
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.840]   your friends is a good thing to do. But yeah, so there's an ethical element, right? Ethics is about
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.840]   what is good and what is evil and right and wrong. And then yeah, the dilemma is there's no real
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.560]   good solution to this problem. If you tell the teacher, your friend's going to be angry at you.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.480]   If you don't tell the teacher, then you're letting the class down. So yeah, that's just the first
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.840]   example that sprung to mind. Indiana, what would you do in that kind of situation? Would you tell
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.200]   the teacher or just zip it? And when I say zip it, we mean like imagine that there's a zipper across
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.320]   our mouth, right? We can just close our mouth and not say anything. Would you zip it or would you tell
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.960]   the teacher? It's like it's there's so many consequences to being a snitch, right? And so a
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.760]   snitch is somebody who would go to the teacher and say, oh, so-and-so did something wrong. So-and-so is
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.320]   not doing what they're supposed to do. That's not good either. So maybe I would find a middle ground
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.800]   or a third option here and like after the test, I would talk to my friend and say, hey, I noticed
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.320]   you were cheating. Don't do that. We need to talk about this. You shouldn't do that and see how that
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.600]   goes. You know, I think that could be a possible solution. But I don't know, have you experienced
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.120]   this before, Andrew, what do you think you would do? Yeah, I think in high school, I definitely
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   wouldn't have said anything. Even in university, I don't think I would have said anything. It depends
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.480]   like on the stakes of the test, right? And like, it also depends on the kind of test. If maybe it
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.320]   would put me at a disadvantage, like if there were a set number of people who get an A in that class
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.360]   and like maybe I wouldn't have gotten A because of my friend cheating, then probably I would have
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.040]   said something. I would have stood up for myself. But if it was like a low stakes exam, I wouldn't
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   say anything. Yeah, you know, we have this expression in English, Indiana, I'm sure you've heard it
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.800]   before, maybe in movies, hopefully never in real life, but definitely on TV and in the movies, I'm
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:06.240]   sure. And that is snitches get stitches, snitches get stitches, right? This is like, if you, if you
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.400]   snitch and snitch means to tell on somebody in this situation, your best friend is cheating, you
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.840]   notice, but the teacher doesn't notice. And then you tell the teacher, this is snitching. And snitches,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   so a snitch is somebody who does this action gets stitches. So I think we hear this a lot and like
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.560]   prison movies, prison dramas, right? Like the prisoner, some prisoner tells the prison guards
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.920]   that some other criminals are doing something bad. And then they beat him up and he gets stitches
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.440]   as a result. Yeah, so you got to be careful when you're snitching. It's not not looked upon highly.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.320]   I have an image in my head of a high school, not high school, probably middle school bully.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.280]   Hitting his fist and his palm, like snitches get stitches threatening another,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.520]   yeah, right, right, classic movie line or something like that.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.240]   Good. Well, Indiana, we have several other of these ethical dilemmas that we'll talk about
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.760]   here in this episode. I think I wrote down five of them. But before we get to those,
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.640]   I should let our listeners know about the study guide for this episode. So guys, we have a helpful
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:23.280]   study guide for this episode created by our awesome team of English teachers here at QLIPs.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.200]   And in the guide, you will get an interactive transcript, plus detailed vocabulary breakdowns
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.040]   and examples and explanations of some of the interesting and useful vocabulary that you'll hear
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.520]   me and Indiana use in this episode. There's also a quiz. And there are questions that you can use
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.280]   for writing practice and speaking practice. And there will also be a small group speaking
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.040]   class about this episode as well. So you can join with other QLIPs members. And we'll practice
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.200]   talking about this topic of ethical dilemmas in a small group setting. And you can get all of this
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.280]   and more. If you are a QLIPs member to sign up and become a QLIPs member today, just visit our

[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.880]   the QLIPs members out there for your support. Guys, we really do appreciate it. So thank you so much.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   Okay. So Indiana, let's get to it. Should we just go through the list one by one? And maybe we'll start.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.240]   Yeah, we'll start with some of the easier ones and then maybe move on to some of the more difficult
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.960]   ones. Let's start with the first one. I'll read it here. It says, "A friend wants to split the bill
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.640]   evenly, but you ordered much less. Do you speak up or let it go?" What would you do in this situation?
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:59.600]   If it's just one friend, it seems like pretty clear and like that difference and who ordered
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.880]   what? Like if it's such a big difference, I would feel a little uncomfortable with the fact that
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.600]   that friend wants to split the bill because I think they would notice. Like it's pretty obvious. I've
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:16.480]   paid so much more than them. So that would already be sort of a problem. Yeah, that's a red flag
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:23.920]   right there. I agree. Maybe there's probably other context, like background information. Maybe,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.560]   I don't know, they're like going through a hard time with money or something. Like these things
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.960]   could color or change my opinion. But if it was just with one friend and there was no other
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.040]   details, they just want me to pay for their food. I would feel a little weird about that. I don't
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.800]   think I would do that. However, if it was a large group that happens all the time where you just kind
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.880]   of have to give up, give in, like, okay, I only ordered one drink and an appetizer, but we're all
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.240]   splitting it evenly. Like sometimes that's just social etiquette and you do it. But one on one,
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.520]   I feel a little uncomfortable about it. I would probably be like, oh, we should pay for what we
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.480]   ordered. But what have you experienced this one before? Andrew, I don't think I've actually ever
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:15.760]   had this happen to me. What have you had this happen to you? No, I don't think just with one
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.600]   friends. I agree with you in the group setting sometimes, and especially if people are drinking,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.840]   right? Like this is kind of annoying that alcohol is really expensive and if one friend has three
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.520]   drinks or somebody else has two drinks and then I have no drinks and then we all have to share
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.160]   the bill equally. That's not fair per se, but it's like, like you said, it's the price of
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:46.480]   hanging out in that kind of situation. But one on one, I don't think I've ever had somebody try
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:53.280]   to pull this on me. I feel like if somebody did do that, they wouldn't be a very close friend.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.760]   Like it would just be weird. And if my friend had money problems, they could just tell me,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.520]   at least I hope they could just tell me. Or if they were having money problems, they would say,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.680]   like, I'm sorry, I can't hang out, can't afford it this week. And then I could just be like,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.640]   I got it or something, right? Like it would happen before, like at the moment when it's time to pay
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.480]   the bill, it's too late. Like what are you bringing this up now for? Yeah, so. Okay, we're in agreement.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.040]   It's a little weird. Yeah, it's it's a weird. I would definitely talk about it for sure.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.800]   Mm hmm. Totally. Okay, good. Let's move on to the next one.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:37.840]   Why don't I read this one? Yeah, go for it. Okay. I don't know. I don't actually remember if you
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:45.840]   have a car or not in in Seoul, but so you can imagine you accidentally dent. So you run into
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:53.680]   and you damage a parked car, but nobody else is around. There's no witnesses. Are you gonna leave
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:06.000]   a note or just kind of pretend it never happened? Yeah, so I don't have a car in Seoul, but probably
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.680]   will soon. I think I'm gonna take some driving lessons. I want to take some driving lessons,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:18.000]   so this kind of thing doesn't happen. Yeah. So I'm planning to take some driving lessons soon and
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.400]   then hopefully get a car before the end of the year and be on the road. So I'm gonna have to make
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.320]   sure that I'm very careful so that this kind of thing doesn't happen. But if I were to ding
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.560]   somebody's car or dent somebody's car and guys, these two words ding and dent just means a little
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.520]   bit of damage. Like the fender is just pushed in a little bit, but there's visible damage, right?
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.640]   It's not like there's, it's not like the car is a write off or anything, just a little bit of damage.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.240]   Yeah, if I did this to somebody's car, of course I would call them or leave a note. Yeah, I wouldn't
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.720]   just, what do you call it, hit and run? Hit and run? No, never. I couldn't do it. I couldn't live
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:04.480]   with myself. How about you? I want to say what you said. But if it was like the tiniest
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:11.840]   ding, the tiniest dent or scratch, I might just throw away all of my morals and just move on.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:19.200]   But if it's so serious, like a really genuine, you know, like, okay, this car clearly got hit,
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   that's not acceptable. I think I would definitely have to, my morals, my heart wouldn't say, okay,
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.560]   Indiana, you should leave a note. Yeah. But I think like a tiny scratch I might move on,
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.280]   especially if it's in a city, like that's kind of the risk you take in having a car in the city.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.760]   I don't know. It doesn't sound very good when I say that out loud. But yeah. Yeah, I don't know,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.640]   I hope like, I think the issue is that when it comes to insurance, there's so many people who make
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:55.120]   a mountain out of a molehill, right? Like it's just a little scratch, but you never know how the other
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.320]   party is going to respond. So sometimes in these situations, people lie about the damage and the
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.960]   cost and it can really throw your insurance rates out of whack and make it really expensive.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:14.720]   And yeah, so like when people respond this way, then it makes it so that you're not incentivized
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:22.480]   to be honest and truthful when something happens. So I'm, yeah, I haven't driven for so long that
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:31.040]   maybe I'm just thinking that, of course, the other party would respond in a measured way. That's like,
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:37.280]   you know, not going crazy and not trying to sue me or take a lot of my money and I could just pay
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.800]   for the damage and move on. But yeah, you always got to be careful. So yeah, driving lessons,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.840]   I think are very important for me. So I can avoid this here in the near future.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:55.520]   And maybe I feel this way too because there was a time when I was like sitting in a parking lot
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:02.320]   of a shopping plaza and like maybe like eating my lunch or something before I had to go do another
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.920]   errand go somewhere and I was sitting in my car and somebody parked next to me and you just opened
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.560]   his door into my car while I was sitting in it and like just walked away. Like he hit my car
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.600]   with his door. There was clearly scratches and then he just left and I was like, what? Okay,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:26.160]   I guess this is the world we live in. Maybe it's okay. I don't know. But that was, I was pretty shocked.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.320]   That was so blatant, right? Like maybe he didn't notice I was in the car, but I was like, hello,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:39.920]   up right here. Did he even stop to check if there were any scratches or not at all? He just opened
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   his door into my car and left. It's really weird. Bizarre. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's just like how
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.520]   things are in your area of the world. Maybe it's just like a scratch and run. Scratch and run,
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:01.200]   yes. Part of the country. I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Interesting. Let's move on to the
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:12.080]   next one. Number three. A coworker takes credit for your idea in a meeting. Would you correct them
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:21.280]   publicly or talk privately later? Definitely. I'm not somebody who would
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.960]   correct somebody publicly or make a big like, I don't want to embarrass somebody. I don't want
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.760]   to make a big stink about something in front of a bunch of people. I don't think I would do that.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:41.120]   But, and even to correct them later, I think it all depends on the, what's the impact of this,
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.640]   this idea or this project? Does this coworker really need a win or to look good in front of the
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.200]   boss? Whereas I have been performing well recently. I might just give it to them depending on
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:57.600]   all of the office politics and like, you know, if it seems maybe it's okay, like they could
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:04.000]   really use this. But no, probably most scenarios, I'll talk to them later and be like, hey, like,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.240]   remember how I came up with it? Like, maybe you can correct this later. Maybe we can talk about,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.560]   yeah. Making sure that I get a little bit of credit for this because that I would also maybe
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:23.200]   have some less, less trust in that coworker from that point on. But it's, it depends, I feel like
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.000]   office politics play a big role in this. What would you do here, Andrew? Yeah, I really don't like
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.360]   public confrontation. So it would depend. This one is really contextual. It would depend on how
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.760]   close I am with the people in the meeting. If I were pretty close, like, if we were on the same team
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:47.360]   and we worked together all the time, then I probably wouldn't mind stirring things up a little bit.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.160]   But if it were like a bigger meeting with people who I don't work with very often,
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.400]   or maybe some bosses who I don't see very often, then probably I would try to not
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:06.160]   cause a big argument or make things awkward in front of everybody. But it also depends on the
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:13.040]   how good the idea was, right? If this, like, changes the company and is like a big windfall
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.520]   for the company and suddenly the profits are going to skyrocket because of this idea.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:23.440]   And it was my idea and it got stolen. And maybe that idea would get me a promotion or
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:29.600]   increased salary or something. And of course, I'd have to stand up for myself. But it was just
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:35.520]   some little idea. It's kind of a jerk thing to do, right? To steal somebody's idea, no matter how
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:42.400]   small it is. But if it was just some tiny little thing, yeah, I'd let it slide where I'd talk about
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   it later, like, hey, that wasn't so cool. It was my idea. Like, could you not do that in the future?
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.920]   I think that would be my approach, but really case by case for this one, I think.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.400]   Definitely. Yeah, it could be not worth it to rock the boat. But yeah, if this becomes a pattern of
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.720]   behavior with this coworker, that's not good. I think we're in agreement on that one.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:13.360]   The next one. Do you want to read the next one, Indiana? Sure, let's do. Okay, imagine you were
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:20.960]   on a plane. Somebody asks you. So typically, let's say it's a big plane and there's the aisle seat,
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.240]   the middle seat, and the window seat. So that's three. And of course, the middle seat is the worst
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.600]   seat. You have the aisle seat, but the person sitting next to you asks if they can have the aisle
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.960]   seat and you get the middle seat, no other context. Would you just give up your seat?
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.560]   What, you know, is that a reasonable request? Do you feel like because you've been asked,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.200]   you shouldn't do it? What would you feel about this scenario?
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:53.760]   I hate when people ask me these kinds of things because I think I'm too nice of a person sometimes,
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:00.640]   and sometimes I just agree even when I don't want to do it. And then later, I regret it.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.720]   It would depend on the reason for sure. Like you said, with no context. So no context,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.000]   somebody just randomly asked me, I want to sit there. Can I sit there? Then I would say, no,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I need the aisle. I think especially like I usually fly between Korea and Canada. So that's
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.760]   eight or nine or 10 hour flight depending on the direction that I'm traveling in. So that's like
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.320]   a super long time. And yeah, I wouldn't want to be in the middle for that long. So I think just
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:36.640]   immediately without any reason about why the person wants to sit in that seat, I would say no,
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.800]   and then probably put my headphones on and try to ignore that person for the rest of the flight.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:47.440]   But if there were some special reason, like if there's a medical condition,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.880]   maybe that person has to get up and go to the bathroom a million times or maybe they have a
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:20:01.600]   child or something, I don't know, some special reason, then yeah, I think generally I tried to be
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:08.160]   helpful when I can. So if there was some way that I could help somebody and it wasn't a huge
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.640]   inconvenience to me, then I probably would try my best to accommodate that. But with no other
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:21.920]   explanation, then I would say no, I think. So let me ask you one more possible context thing here.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:28.160]   I mean, it's not so much more background information. But you say, oh, is there a reason? And they
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.040]   just say, I really prefer the aisle seat. And that's the, you know, it's not medical. It's just
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.200]   that they really feel very strongly about having the aisle seat. Is that enough to like put you
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:47.440]   over the edge and be the guy? So do I really prefer the aisle seat? I'm sorry, that's not enough,
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:53.760]   I think in that kind of situation snooze you lose, right? You didn't choose the aisle seat or you
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:59.200]   checked in too late or something. I'm sorry, it's first come first serve. You can pay extra to
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.040]   upgrade your seat. But yeah, it would have to be like some kind of special, special situation where
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.640]   I would try to accommodate that. But just because you prefer it, it's not going to cut it, unfortunately.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:17.600]   I'm not that nice. I'm nice, but I'm not that nice. Yeah. The same for you, Indiana.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.680]   I think so. Maybe it depends on my mood. And if it's a short flight and somebody just,
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.960]   if they feel so strongly as to ask me, maybe I'll say, all right, I'll get some good karma and,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.520]   you know, maybe something nice will happen to be later. But I don't know, probably not. But
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.560]   if I was in a good mood and it wasn't like South Korea, Canada, there's no way that's too long of a
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:47.200]   flight. I should maybe I'll just be nice. But I would feel like, wow, I wish I could be so bold as
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.040]   to just ask to have the good seat. I don't think I would ever do that unless there was like a really
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:00.640]   good reason, you know. Yeah, the asking is wild to me. I'm not that brave. I don't think I could
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.800]   ask a stranger just for no reason to change. I mean, there's no harm in asking, right? As long as
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.080]   you're not a jerk about the reaction, I guess it's okay. But that just wouldn't even cross my mind
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:19.360]   to ask. I think I would just accept right from the start that, yeah, that that expression snooze,
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:27.280]   you lose, I snoozed and I lost. So yeah, exactly. Okay, let's go on to the next one.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:36.960]   Oh, this one is a good one. You're at at the store at the checkout and you're charged far less than
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:44.720]   the tagged price. Do you speak up and tell the cashier or do you just quickly squirrel out of the store,
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:53.280]   run away, sneak out of the store and stay quiet. I think it all comes down to like
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:04.080]   for me. Okay, is this a giant box store like, you know, Macy's or is this Walmart or I don't know,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.760]   some really huge corporation that makes a lot of money. I would probably just say, oh, it's the
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.840]   cost of doing business. Sometimes your equipment makes a mistake, your checkout. Yeah, it's, oh,
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.880]   sometimes you lose, right? And I feel like, okay, I got to win. But if it's like a small store,
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.280]   you know, a local store, there's only one location and it's like, I don't want that place to go out of
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:34.480]   business because they, you know, their system goofed or made a mistake or their cashier messed
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:41.760]   up. Like that's, that's kind of, I don't know. For me, I feel like sometimes it's like, yeah,
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.160]   I would just feel really lucky if it was some, some really big store that I think rakes in tons of
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.160]   profits. But yeah, it's kind of a depends on the size of the store. And if I think this is actually
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.840]   going to impact them, because it's very impactful for me, potentially, like, wow, I'm saving so much
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.080]   money and like, I'm not rich, right? Like this could really be beneficial for me right now. So
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.840]   I think it would depend. That would be my main, like, concern is this actually going to really
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.320]   hurt the store's profits or not? Yeah, I don't know. I feel like, like, that's kind of, um,
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.720]   I want to get free stuff or cheap stuff. Am I just sort of justifying it so that I feel
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.480]   okay about it? I don't know. But I do feel like that's immediately my feeling about it. What do you
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.640]   think, Andrew? How would you, how would you pursue it? Yeah, that was my immediate thought as well.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:37.840]   I'd be concerned, you know, if it's a mom and pop store, then definitely I'd want to support
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.400]   them. And I wouldn't let that slide. I'd also be concerned if it was an employee that made the
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:50.720]   error and not just like maybe barcode error. So like, if I knew the cashier would potentially
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:57.920]   get in trouble, then maybe I'd be more likely to go back. But yeah, if it was like a big evil
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.720]   corporation, you know, unfortunately, it is true that a lot of these, at least in Canada, and I know
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.480]   in the USA as well, a lot of these big box stores, they do a lot of shady stuff. They're not,
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.200]   they don't treat their employees really well. They don't pay their employees a fair wage in many
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:22.320]   situations. They exploit the workers. They exploit the customers. They in Canada, there's been all
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.080]   these scandals about price fixing where they work together to artificially set the price of bread.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:35.200]   This was a huge scandal where they're ripping us off on the prices of bread. So like, that doesn't
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:42.960]   make me feel like any, any, I guess there's no good feelings, no good will between me and these big
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.160]   box stores. So I think if I were shopping and then I checked out and I did everything correct,
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.880]   I wasn't stealing, you know, I, I went through the cashier and I paid the bill. And then later,
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:58.320]   I noticed, well, I got this for free. I'd be like, well, yeah, nice. Sometimes you win.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.120]   Yeah, exactly. Totally agree.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.960]   I think in that situation, yeah, I probably would just take the win. Yeah.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:14.400]   But again, it depends on like the item and how much, how much it was to like, I saw recently on
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:21.520]   Reddit, some guy on Amazon, he ordered a graphics card for his computer and they accidentally sent
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.720]   him the wrong graphics card and they sent him this, I don't know about graphics cards, really,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:33.120]   or GPUs, I guess they're called. But the GPU that he got sent was this really hard to find one.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.120]   And it was a lot more like way, way, way more expensive. And I think he also, I mean, I don't
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.280]   know if this is true or not, it's just what I saw on the internet. But I think they also sent him
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.840]   too many. So he ordered one, but he got a way better one. And he also got like five or six or
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.520]   something. So, and that's what he was asking. It's like, what do I do guys? Do I send these back?
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.680]   Or do I keep them? And everybody on Reddit was like, keep it, keep it. Yeah, agreed.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:07.440]   So, yeah, I think a lot of people feel this way, especially Amazon, you know, notoriously
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.120]   terrible for our world. So take the win. All right. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:20.720]   Got a got a punch back when you can. Okay. Last one. Now, this one is more serious,
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.960]   I think. And is this one's a tough one. I'm not sure. What do you think? Final one here. And
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:34.080]   Indiana, why don't you read this last one for us? This one is a bit serious. So you find out,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:41.440]   let's say the evidence that you have is there's no question about it. This is definitely happening.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:47.520]   Your friend's partner, maybe their girlfriend, their boyfriend, their spouse is cheating on them.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:55.280]   What are you going to do? Are you going to tell your friend and blow up their marriage,
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.520]   their relationship? And are you going to keep it a secret because you don't want them to get hurt?
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:10.080]   Yeah, serious situation. I think like a friend, a close friend, even, even maybe like not that
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:17.440]   close with a friend, like just maybe even an acquaintance. Hard to say, but at least for friends,
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:24.720]   of course, I think I would share that information. I'm just trying to think about my best friends.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.840]   I wouldn't want my best friends to be taken advantage of in that kind of situation. So I
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:38.400]   think definitely I would share share that info. If I had that intel, right? How about you, Indiana?
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:44.960]   I mean, I wouldn't want to like wreck their marriage, but or wreck their relationship doesn't
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.200]   necessarily have to be a marriage. But I just think that's like so shady. And I wouldn't want
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:58.400]   them to just be living a lie almost. So I think I definitely would tell. And then later, if my
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.600]   friend were to find out that I knew and I didn't say anything, then that maybe could impact our
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.000]   friendship too. So I'd have to think about that as well. So I think, yeah, I would share it. I
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.160]   wouldn't keep quiet on that. How about you? Totally agree. It's worth it to have the truth.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.760]   And to know that your friend is not going to keep things hidden from you just to protect you. I
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:27.440]   think that's, yeah, I think that's worth it. What gets tricky, I think, is if the partner who's
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:35.200]   cheating on your friend is also your friend, like, then you're kind of between, okay, who am I,
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.640]   you know, faithful or loyal to? In that scenario, I still think it's ultimately the best thing to do
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:47.120]   is like, that person needs to find out. Maybe I would go to the cheating partner. It's going to be
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:52.560]   the most uncomfortable conversation, but be like, I know what's happening. You need to tell your
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.520]   partner, I don't want to do this. Like it's not my place. You need to do this. That's right. But
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:04.640]   that's also like so so much easier said than done, you know, so right now. Yeah, these kind of
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:11.840]   relationship problems suck. And yeah, it reminds me of like when when you have friends, like your
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.720]   friends with both people, and then they break up and you sort of have to choose who you're going to
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:23.440]   be friends with, right? That also sucks. Like if the relationship sours and then the friend group
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:30.720]   can splinter. These are just like really awkward social situations. Thankfully, now that I'm getting
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.080]   older, it seems like they don't happen as much as they used to. But in my twenties, when relationships
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:43.760]   were a lot more turbulent, seem to happen from time to time. Well, Indiana, I think we're pretty
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:49.360]   much like our morals are pretty much aligned. I'd say it was just the parked car one that maybe we
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.800]   differ on. Yeah. Other than that, I think we're pretty much the same. I think so, which is good.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:00.720]   I mean, I guess I don't know if the aisle seat one, the airplane scenario is so moral or more just
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.680]   like putting up boundaries and standing up for yourself. But yeah, I'd say we're a couple of ethical
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:14.480]   folks. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And now, of course, what we'd love to do is turn it over to our listeners.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:20.480]   So guys, we really want to hear your thoughts and opinions on these issues. And the best place to
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.640]   share your opinion with us is on our Discord server. It's free for everyone to join. It's where the
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:33.200]   Qloops community gathers and we share stories with each other. We practice English together,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.720]   speaking and listening and reading and writing all of the skills. And we just grow our skills
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:44.960]   together. So you can join the server for free. The link is in the description for this episode. And
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:50.720]   we are looking forward to hearing what you have to say. Okay, Indiana, I know that your camera
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   is dying. You only have a few minutes of recording left. So we got to wrap things up. But thanks so
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.760]   much for your help. Of course. Yeah, it was fun discussing hashing out these ethical dilemmas
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:08.640]   with you, Andrew. Yeah, it was surprisingly fun. I agree. So yeah, thank you, Indiana. Take care.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:15.600]   And guys, we'll talk to you in the next episode. Until then, bye bye.
