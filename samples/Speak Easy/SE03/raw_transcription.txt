[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Hey everybody, my name is Andrew.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.040]   - And I'm Suzanne.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.560]   - And you're listening to QLips.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.800]   - Hello Suzanne.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.560]   - Hello Andrew, how are you?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.200]   - I'm good, how are you?
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.720]   - I'm pretty good.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.920]   I'm pretty good, a little sleepy today,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.520]   but doing pretty good.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.400]   - A little sleepy, did you have a long day?
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.680]   - Today was a long day.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.880]   - We're recording this mid week, Suzanne.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.040]   It's Tuesday, so that means it's almost hump day, right?
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040]   We call Wednesday hump day,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.960]   and we call Wednesday hump day because,
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.200]   well, it's all downhill after Wednesday, right?
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.200]   The weekend is in sight, so this is good news, right?
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.720]   - Yeah, it kind of reminds me of the topic
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.440]   of our Speak Easy episode.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.440]   Wednesday kind of links the beginning of the week
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.160]   to the end of the week, and the weekend.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.280]   - Ooh, yeah, very good connection,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   very good segue, Suzanne, I'm impressed.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.720]   And yeah, guys, so like Suzanne just mentioned,
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.720]   today we are doing a Speak Easy episode,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.800]   and Speak Easy is our pronunciation series
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.000]   where Suzanne teaches us how to improve our accents
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.320]   and speak English really, really naturally,
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.560]   to sound natural when we speak.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.240]   Just before we get started,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.360]   I wanna let everybody know that the study guide
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.480]   for this episode is available for download
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.480]   on qlips.com, our website, c-u-l-i-p-s.com.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   So if you want to study along with the study guide,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.200]   visit the website and give it a download.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.680]   Okay, Suzanne.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.320]   So what are we going to be studying today?
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.680]   - Well, Andrew, whenever you hear English spoken,
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.000]   like from your friends or fluent second language speakers,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.240]   you may notice, and tell me if I'm wrong,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.120]   but you may notice that a lot of the times
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.920]   the words blend together.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.200]   - Yeah, it's true.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.520]   Sometimes it's almost like I don't know
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.160]   where one word ends and where another word begins.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.400]   It's like a steady stream of words.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.200]   - Yeah, like sometimes it sounds like one big word
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.160]   instead of many words making one thought.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.400]   And that is because most of the time
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   they're using a form of connected speech called linking.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.400]   - Linking, okay.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   So this is actually kind of pronunciation feature, linking.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.920]   - Yeah.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.120]   So today we're gonna take a look at some of the ways
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   that we can make our speech more fluent by linking words.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.880]   - Okay, very good.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.000]   So we'll study how to link words together
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.200]   to make our speech sound more fluent.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   - Yeah. - So how do native speakers link birds?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.440]   How do they connect words together?
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.000]   - Well, one of the ways that they link words together
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.840]   is that they take the end of one word,
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.680]   so the last sound of one word, like a consonant, for example,
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.600]   and they link it or carry it over
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.400]   to the beginning sound of the next word.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.640]   Usually, let's say in this episode, it's going to be a vowel.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.840]   So linking a consonant at the end of one word
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.600]   to the vowel sound in the next word.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.520]   - Okay, very good.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.480]   You know, Suzanne, I think here an example
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.320]   could be very useful.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.160]   - Totally.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.400]   - Could you give us a concrete example
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.560]   of what this looks like or what this sounds like in speech?
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.640]   - Sure.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.960]   So say we have the word pot, right?
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.920]   Like you're cooking in a pot.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.040]   - Okay, pot.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.080]   - Yeah.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.600]   Or cap, like you're wearing your baseball cap.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.320]   Or book, right?
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.960]   You're reading a book.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   So those end with a T, a T sound, a P,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.760]   or a P sound, and a K, K, K sound, right?
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.600]   - Yeah.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   - Let's look at the phrase, put the pot on the stove, right?
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.080]   Put the pot on the stove.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.880]   Put the pot on the stove.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.760]   We're taking the T from pot.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.440]   And we're carrying it over
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.640]   and we're bringing that sound into the word on,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.760]   pot on, pot on, pot on the stove.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.080]   I see, so we actually carry the pronunciation
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   of that T over to the start of the word on.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.840]   So it's not pot on, but pot on.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.680]   - Yeah, pot on, exactly.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.280]   - Okay, pot on.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.640]   - You wanna try that phrase?
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.160]   - Yeah, so put the pot on the stove.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.040]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.000]   - How did that sound?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.200]   Did I do a good job?
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.760]   - You were fantastic.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.640]   That's why they pay you the big bucks Andrew.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.720]   - That's why I'm making the big bucks, yeah.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.640]   (laughing)
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.320]   - So let's look at the next word cap, right?
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.200]   Like your hat, your cap.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.080]   So in the phrase took my cap out of the box,
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.640]   you might carry that P in cap over to the word out.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   Like cap out, took my cap out of the box.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.480]   Took my cap out of the box.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.320]   You wanna try it?
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.600]   - All right.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.040]   Yeah, took my cap out of the box.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   - Yeah, it almost sounds like the word is pronounced cap out.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.480]   (laughing)
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.320]   Right?
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.320]   - Yeah, now what about this Suzanne?
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   In this phrase, we have cap out of the word,
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   out is followed by of, which also starts with a vowel.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.440]   - Exactly.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.640]   - So do we have two instances of this happening
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.880]   in the same phrase?
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.680]   - Exactly, you're exactly right, we do.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.520]   - Okay.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.120]   - So we have the P going over to the O sound in out
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.120]   and the T in out, going over to the U sound of of,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.720]   cap out of the box.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.440]   - Cap out of the box.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.280]   - Very nice, okay.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.840]   And you have another example here,
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.680]   I think with that word book, right?
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   So say we have the phrase, put the book up on the shelf.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.640]   So here, we're going to carry the K sound in book
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.720]   over to the U sound in up.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.680]   And I bet you probably noticed that the P
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   in up is also going to be carried over to the O sound in on.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.720]   So put the book up on the shelf.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.200]   Put the book up on the shelf.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.960]   - Put the book up on the shelf.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.800]   - Yeah.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.280]   - The book up on the shelf.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.040]   Put the book up on the shelf.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.240]   - Exactly.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.440]   So you don't want to stress it so much
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.440]   so that you're saying book up, but you want to connect the words.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.480]   So it's book up, book up on the shelf.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.440]   So it's a more delicate connection.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.120]   You don't want to stress it too hard.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.640]   Otherwise it doesn't sound like the actual words
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.320]   you want to communicate.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.360]   So you just want to make sure that it's a delicate connection.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.960]   - Right, they are linked.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.800]   There is a connection there.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.640]   - Yeah.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.640]   And I think maybe this is not totally new
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.720]   to a lot of our listeners.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.200]   I know in the Korean language,
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.680]   this kind of connected speech happens.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.840]   It also happens in French, right?
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.040]   So it's very likely that in our listeners,
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.040]   native languages that this kind of linking also happens.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.200]   - Exactly.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.600]   I do know that a lot of times when you're learning
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   a new language, we don't expect it to be like ours.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.840]   So we sometimes ignore the similarities
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.960]   and we don't realize that in our language,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.640]   there might also be linking
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.760]   and maybe in the language we're learning,
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.920]   there could be linking as well.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.240]   So it's just a nice reminder that it's there
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.080]   and you can use those skills
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.560]   from your first language into your second language.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   - One thing I noticed with all of these examples
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.320]   that you provided Suzanne is that they all occur
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.720]   with prepositions, right?
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.560]   - Yes.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.320]   - On, out, up.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   And actually prepositions in English start with vowels, right?
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.520]   In, on, up, under, there's a couple that don't like down.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.360]   - Yeah.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.520]   - Or from.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.760]   But most of them start with vowels.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.760]   And so I think when you're saying a prepositional phrase
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.640]   or using a phrasal verb,
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.320]   you're gonna have this connected speech
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.280]   occurring almost all the time.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.400]   - Absolutely.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.280]   Like pick up or put on, right?
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.320]   Put on.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320]   - Put on.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.200]   - Pick up, back out.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.000]   That's something you definitely will hear
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.960]   in a lot of phrasal verbs
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.240]   because yeah, those phrasal verbs start with an action
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.600]   and then include a direction.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.440]   And usually in English, the directions start with a vowel, right?
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.520]   So this is just another thing
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.240]   that makes phrasal verbs difficult to learn.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.440]   Sorry, guys.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.560]   - Yeah, but this can maybe help you sound
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.360]   a little bit more fluent when you do it.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.880]   Hey, Andrew, do you wanna listen to some dialogues
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.240]   with some examples of linking in them?
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.000]   - Yeah, let's do that right now.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:36.080]   - Hey, can you pick up the dry cleaning on your way home?
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.760]   - Oh, I wish I could,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.360]   but I have a late meeting on the other end of town.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.480]   - No problem.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.760]   I'm just in the middle of a huge deadline
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.800]   and it's already five o'clock.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.460]   - Okay, let me see if I can arrange something.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.040]   Is it open until six?
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.280]   If so, I think I can pop on over.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.720]   - That's amazing if you can swing it.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.600]   I know it's tight, but I need those shirts over the weekend.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.140]   - No worries, I'm on it.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.280]   Okay, Andrew, let's listen to the dialogue again,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.160]   but this time a little bit slower.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.240]   And see if you can notice the linking happening
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.360]   and maybe you can also notice
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.440]   that the words that usually link
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.880]   are articles or prepositions
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.520]   or things that we don't normally stress very often
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.480]   and can sometimes blend together so quickly
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.900]   that we don't even notice that we're linking them.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.040]   So let's listen to that a bit slower.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.360]   - Okay.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:52.120]   Hey, can you pick up the dry cleaning on your way home?
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.960]   - Oh, I wish I could,
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   but I have a late meeting on the other end of town.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.200]   - No problem.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.360]   I'm just in the middle of a huge deadline
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.280]   and it's already five o'clock.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.680]   - Okay, let me see if I can arrange something.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.000]   Is it open until six?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.840]   If so, I think I can pop Bon over.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.600]   - That's amazing if you can swing it.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.560]   I know it's tight, but I need those shirts over the weekend.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.200]   - No worries, I'm on it.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.320]   So Suzanne, there were tons of examples
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.320]   of connected speech and linking in that dialogue example.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.940]   Unfortunately, we don't have time to pick out each one
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.480]   and describe them to all of the listeners.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.640]   But guys, once again, the study guides on qlips.com
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.640]   and we will make sure to illustrate in the study guide
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   the examples of linking.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.240]   So you can check that out in the study guide.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.120]   For now, Suzanne, I think let's listen
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.800]   to one more dialogue example.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.680]   Again, we'll play it at regular speed
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.480]   and we'll read it slowed down
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.800]   so that everyone can hear the examples
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.640]   of linking that are in this dialogue.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.720]   So, yeah, how about we listen to that right now?
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.840]   - Sounds good.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:45.600]   - Hey, didn't you run in the marathon this weekend?
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.840]   - Yeah, it was an amazing experience,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.080]   but at times I felt like I couldn't keep up.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.560]   I was trying to beat my record time.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.400]   - Wow, that's pretty impressive though.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.480]   How did it feel finishing such a feat?
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.600]   - Honestly, by the end of the day, I was worn out
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.240]   and had trouble walking up the stairs to my apartment.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.280]   - Did you guys celebrate?
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.360]   - Yeah, we joined Dan and Jane over at their place.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.840]   They cooked up a big meal
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.120]   and put on some relaxing music.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.720]   - Oh, so it ended up being a great day, congrats.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.280]   - Yeah, next year it's your turn to join in on the run.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.160]   So everyone, this example you may notice,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.840]   it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.160]   It's kind of a silly conversational example,
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.720]   but it is a really great example
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   for demonstrating the linking
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.560]   that we're talking about today.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   So even if you're listening to it
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.120]   and you're like, what are those guys talking about?
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.480]   It's kind of weird.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.920]   Don't worry, it's not a conversation example.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.080]   It's a pronunciation example with the linked speech
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.280]   and sue in that example.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.280]   There were tons of instances of linked speech, weren't there?
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.920]   - Absolutely.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.480]   Lots of examples of words ending in consonants
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   that are linked over to the vowels of the next word.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.040]   - So just like we did for the first example,
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.960]   let's slow it down for everybody
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.840]   so that everyone can really clearly hear
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   the instances of linking that are in this example.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:52.540]   - Hey, didn't you run in the marathon this weekend?
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   - Yeah, it was an amazing experience
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.800]   but at times I felt like I couldn't keep up.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.360]   I was trying to beat my record time.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.520]   - Wow, that's pretty impressive though.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.200]   How did it feel finishing such a feat?
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   - Honestly, by the end of the day I was worn out
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.640]   and had trouble walking up the stairs to my apartment.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.840]   - Did you guys celebrate?
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.920]   - Yeah, we joined Dan and Jane over at their place.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.840]   They cooked up a big meal
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.680]   and put on some relaxing music.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.080]   - Oh, so it ended up being a great day.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.600]   Congrats.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.120]   - Yeah, next year it's your turn to join in on the run.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:07.840]   - Well guys, today we learned a simple trick
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.000]   that helps our speech flow
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.480]   and sound a bit more fluent.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.160]   It's called linking.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.120]   So remember, you can link word final consonants
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.840]   over to the vowel at the beginning of the following word
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.280]   and this will help your speech flow smoothly.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.720]   - Awesome, thank you so much.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.240]   Pronunciation teacher Sue
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   for letting us all know about how to link our speech
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.160]   and make it sound more fluent and more natural.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.700]   - My pleasure Andrew.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.240]   - Just before we let you go,
