[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Simplified Speech, the Q-LIP series which features clear,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.360]   natural, and easy to understand everyday English conversations. Today, I am joined by my co-host
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.000]   Indiana, and we're going to talk all about her recent trip to the state of Colorado.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.840]   Hey, Indiana, how's it going? Hey, Andrew. I'm good. A little bit slightly jet-lagged because of that
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.400]   two-hour time difference between here and Colorado, but not too bad. How about you?
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.520]   I'm doing good, and I'm laughing because it's really true that jet-lagged feeling can happen
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.960]   when you travel across North America. I know I've had that happen to me before, traveling between
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.800]   British Columbia, my home province, and Quebec and Montreal, where I used to live. There's just a
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.640]   three-hour time difference, but it really threw me out of whack when I'd go from one time zone to
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.800]   the next. Even though now, looking back, it seems like no big deal because I live in Korea and
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.480]   the time difference between Korea and Canada is much bigger, but yeah, it's true. You can get
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.240]   just thrown off your daily routine with that kind of time change, right?
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:18.880]   Definitely, and I visited my brother-in-law in Colorado, and he is kind of a night owl,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.840]   whereas I'm a morning person, so that also totally threw off my schedule, and we were staying with
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.440]   him, so yeah, I'm all out of whack as well. All right, well, I'm excited to hear about your trip.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.680]   I have always wanted to visit Colorado, but I've never had the opportunity yet, and I say yet,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.760]   because definitely sometime in the future, I would just love to visit. So yeah, let's get into it,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.640]   and hear about how your trip went, and I think you told us in a recent Q-Lips episode that you
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.880]   were going there for a wedding. Do I have that information correct? Did you go to Colorado for
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.960]   a wedding? That was the main goal of the trip? Yeah, that was the original reason for the trip,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.200]   but since my brother-in-law lives there as well, we kind of turned it into a trip to visit him,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.080]   and a friend of my husband's who lives outside of Denver as well, so yes. But the wedding was the
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.640]   main purpose of the trip, and it was lovely. It was a wedding for a family friend of my husband's.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.200]   What was really great about it, though, was the venue. It was in the mountains, it was in
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.160]   Golden, Colorado, which is outside of Denver as well, and it was surrounded by Aspen trees,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   which they kind of look like birches, birches with that white bark, but they're just really
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.680]   beautiful. It was a stunning backdrop to the wedding. Could you paint a picture for us of what
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.600]   the landscape is like in Colorado with your words? Maybe in the YouTube version of this episode,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.920]   I can put some Colorado pictures up, and I don't know, Indiana, if you took some pictures,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.520]   maybe of the landscape, you could send them to me, and I'll put them in the video version,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.040]   but just for our listeners who are listening to the audio, what kind of landscape do you see in
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:23.200]   Colorado? Colorado, well, Denver is very high elevation, and it is near the Rockies or surrounded
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.680]   by mountains, so compared to where I'm from in the Northeast, I'm from New York, right?
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.640]   We have a lot of trees, and trees will grow really, really easily, like if you just kind of left land
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.440]   to its own devices, it just left it on its own. Eventually, a lot of trees would grow there.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.120]   That's the sort of environment that I'm surrounded by in New York, but in Colorado,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.720]   the trees are a different type of tree. You see a lot more pine and Aspen, like I mentioned, but
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.920]   they don't grow as densely, or they don't just grow as easily, so there are these beautiful
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   mountains that are sort of bare in some parts, but then you see these sparse patches of trees,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.200]   like pine and Aspen, so it makes it a very different sort of feeling with the trees surrounding you,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.480]   and yeah, it is a very, very mountainous landscape, so you might have some flat areas,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.280]   but then in the distance, you're always seeing these beautiful mountains, so in that way, I think
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.480]   that's how I would differentiate the Colorado landscape to my own in the Northeast.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.840]   Okay, yeah, awesome. And you mentioned that it was really high, like a high city, high altitude.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.680]   I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, or if you know this, but I think the nickname for Denver,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.080]   is it the Mile High City? Is that what they call it? Yeah, I think that's right, in the Mile High
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.720]   City. So it means it's like really high altitude-wise, right? And I know like I'm an ice hockey fan, so
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.320]   whenever my favorite ice hockey team, the Vancouver Canucks, when they go to Colorado to play the
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.600]   Colorado Avalanche, they always say that the players have a difficult time adjusting
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.480]   to the altitude, because there's less oxygen in the air, and it's just harder to be athletic in that
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.560]   kind of situation. Did you notice anything like that? Did you feel like you are out of breath a
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.640]   little bit in such a high altitude, or did it not really affect you at all? So just walking around,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.880]   I didn't feel any difference, but when I did a little jog, like I was doing my physical therapy,
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.160]   running practice, some listeners may remember that I had surgery in December, I'm finally
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.240]   getting back to like a little bit of running, baby steps there. So when I took a quick run,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.400]   like 15 minutes, really short, but a quick run in a park, I was definitely winded, like it was
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.640]   noticeable with that elevation change. And when I went on a hike, it was like also very clear.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.200]   I was thinking like, oh, I'm not this out of shape, am I? It was really the elevation.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.240]   It does make it a lot. The air is thinner, it makes it harder to breathe. So get that oxygen
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:20.080]   that you need. Wow, very interesting. Okay. Indiana, I wanted to circle back to the wedding,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.360]   just for a moment, because you said that the wedding was for a family friend. And I think
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.120]   that would be a good term to define and maybe talk about here for a moment for all of our listeners,
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.920]   because kind of is like, I think if you were learning English and you heard family friends,
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.600]   you would be confused. Is it a family member? Is it a friend? Who is it? And we also have this
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.800]   term, friend of the family. So maybe we could talk about these two for a second. What do you
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:58.560]   mean by family friend? Yeah, so I, what I refer to as a family friend, that's usually somebody who
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.680]   maybe your parents or close members of your family, they have a friend outside of the family
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.520]   that you grew up seeing, they're close, they've been friends for a long time. And maybe they also
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.920]   have kids that are your age. So you kind of spent a lot of time with those kids growing up.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.120]   And I think that's what I would call a family friend. So maybe you didn't go out and make that
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.440]   friend yourself. But because there is this connection from this person, you're not related to your
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.320]   close family, you're quite familiar with them. And you've known them for a very long time.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   It's kind of funny, some of my family friends, like really, it's more like my parents' friends,
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:46.080]   I guess, originally, but you're right. Like often, I think when when you're growing up, when you're
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.280]   a family and you have kids, you are friends with other parents that have kids around the similar age,
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.280]   right? You kind of grow up together, right? Your families grow up together. And so I know that I
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.040]   have a lot of these family friends as well, where our families would hang out. And we would do this
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.880]   all the time growing up as kids and as we were teenagers. But then after I graduated high school,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.280]   and I moved away, then I don't really see those family friends anymore. But my parents still do.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:22.000]   And so as a result, I hear lots of stories about the kids, but I don't really stay in touch with
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.040]   them anymore. But it's like, yeah, it's kind of fun. And then if you do run into each other again,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:36.080]   like this happened to me recently at Christmas, actually. One of my family friends was the sun
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.760]   from that family was in town and he had lived in a different place for a long time. And then
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:48.000]   he was back in our hometown and my parents invited him over because he was around and I was reunited
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.880]   with him for the first time in like 20 years. So but it felt very comfortable because we grew up
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.200]   together, you know, and you're like your friends and you hear lots of stories from each other. So,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.600]   yeah, I guess this is what the meaning of family friends is. Okay, anyways, let's continue with
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.800]   your trip. So some of the highlights you said that you went for a hike and you are out of breath
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:15.280]   because of the thin air. Anything else that you could tell us about the hike? Like, let's get
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:22.720]   into that a little bit. Yeah, so I don't really remember the name of the trail or the mountain we
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:31.360]   were on exactly. But we were visiting my husband's friend from college in this town called Georgetown,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.760]   which sounds like it would be an orthist town, but it was this tiny mountain town outside of Denver,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:44.640]   maybe an hour 15 away up in the mountains, like in a little valley between some really, really big
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.520]   mountains. So the elevation was even higher than in Denver. And so we went on this beautiful hike.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:10:01.280]   The I would describe as perhaps an alpine hike because there are these these pine trees all over
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:07.520]   the place. And again, it was it was not like a thick forest, but you would see these patches of
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:14.400]   pine trees sparsely distributed on these beautiful mountains. And there was a lot of snow actually
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:22.080]   because it was such high altitude, not like covering the whole ground, but in patches. And I
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.280]   would love to add a photo to the study guide for this episode because it is just it was so
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.760]   beautiful, stunning, absolutely stunning. And the coolest thing I think about this hike
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:43.040]   was the wildlife. We got to see a big horn, which is, I guess, kind of like similar to a mountain
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:49.360]   goat. And we saw a mountain goat and we had to wait for it to pass on the trail because it was
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.080]   it was feeding on some some grass or some some patches of shrubs. And there was a really narrow
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.000]   trail. We were waiting for it to pass. We tried to sort of approach it a little bit to see if it
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.920]   would run off. And then it stomped its back foot, like kind of aggressively like get away from me.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.640]   So we were like, okay, we should just let this goat do its thing and see when it leaves. It took
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:22.400]   like 15, 20 minutes, but it was fine. There are a little bit scary and I've seen them charge people
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.680]   before. So I think you did the right thing. Just let it let it eat and move on.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:36.960]   Exactly. I didn't want to get gored that day by the goat. But it was very cool to see very
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:47.120]   shaggy fur. Yeah. And one other cool pit of wildlife on this hike was we saw there were lots of sort of
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:54.560]   there was rubble or rocks, like a lot of rocks where maybe little creatures, little animals could
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.680]   hide in. And we saw these little, you know, at first I was like, are these gophers or what kind of
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:10.720]   what kind of animal is this tiny sort of squirrel-like chipmunk-like little mammal on the on the rocks?
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.320]   They were so cute. And I could hear them squeaking. And there was a bunch of them on these rocks. They
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:22.800]   were really adorable. I looked them up later and they were pikas. And I think that's the inspiration
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:30.640]   for the Pokemon. If everybody remembers the 90s, the Pokemon Pikachu. Wow. And they were just, I
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.960]   encourage everybody to look up a picture of pikas. They are so adorable. I was thrilled to see them.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:45.120]   Did they make a little pika-pika sound like Pikachu? I wish. More like a squeak, but that would have been
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:54.800]   mind-blowing. Wow, that's awesome. And what about the big horn sheep? Did it have the curled horn,
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:02.160]   like that classic curved horn? Yeah, it did. It was really, there was sort of a group of them. I
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:09.200]   suppose you could call them a herd, if it's sheep, a herd of them. Yeah. And yeah, that was actually
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.040]   on the drive, on the way up to the start of the hike. They were kind of in the road passing. That
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:22.720]   was really great to see. Wow, sounds amazing. Okay, I love it. And now you mentioned also in our
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:30.080]   previous episode that you wanted to check out some of the craft breweries in Denver and in Colorado,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:37.840]   because I think, well, probably, I was going to say, Colorado is pretty famous for craft breweries,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.440]   and I think that's true. But I think a lot of places are famous for good craft breweries these
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.400]   days. Like, it's kind of all over the place in North America, but maybe one of the OG, the original,
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:56.480]   like, hotspots for a good craft beer was in Colorado and probably still is. So did you manage to check
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   out any of the craft breweries? I did. I kind of wish we had had time to go to a couple more,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:11.520]   but we went to two. Yeah, one was called knotted root, and I tried a few different kinds of beer
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:18.640]   there. One of them was an IPA, but the really incredible one was a Berliner vice. So I suppose
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:26.480]   that's sort of a sour beer, not as sour as you might get if you ordered something that was listed
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:35.120]   as a sour, maybe a little gentler taste, a little less intense sour flavor. But it was wonderful.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   It was kind of like creamy and a little bit thick. Yeah, Berliner vice from knotted root was really,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:48.480]   really good. And we also went to one called Avery, which I think was a boulder. So that's about like
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:55.520]   45, 50 minutes away from Denver. And that was a brewery I had been to like eight years ago,
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.560]   the last time I went to Colorado. So I was really excited to go back because I remember it was so
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:07.520]   good. So yeah, we tried flights. So flights are when you get a little taster of several different
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:13.600]   kinds of beer, maybe like five or six ounces each. So we had some some flights of many different
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.280]   kinds of beer there. And it was amazing. It was great. Nice. Yeah, I like the sampler, the flight.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.880]   So that's a cool idea. Was there anything else that you wanted to talk about about your trip,
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.000]   any other highlights or points of interest that you think our listeners might find interesting?
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:38.720]   Perhaps the last thing that was pretty interesting would be there is an art installation.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:49.280]   I'm not sure. I know that there are is called meow wolf. Meow wolf. Okay. Meow like the sound
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:56.800]   of cat makes and then wolf like meow wolf. It's hard to say even meow wolf. Yeah. There's many
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   different locations. And I think what my brother-in-law told me was that each location has a different
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:10.960]   theme or story or art inside. But it's kind of like this massive building that has this huge art
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:19.840]   installation that it's kind of like. So the one that I went to in Denver, it was a huge facility.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:26.960]   I think I read that it was 90,000 square feet. And there's all these different rooms that are
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:35.440]   filled with art and sort of stuffed creatures or instruments playing on the walls that are
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:42.880]   meant to be. It's kind of like you're entering. You go into the elevator, you go up to the next
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.440]   floor and it's supposed to be like you're entering an alien world. And there's all this
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.800]   text on the walls. And like if you if anybody has seen the who's listening has seen the movie
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.520]   Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger from I think I said it was probably the 80s or maybe
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.640]   the 90s. It was just like just like the alien landscape like when he goes to the moon in that
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:13.520]   movie. It's really surreal, really crazy kind of like sensory overload with all of the visuals and
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:21.200]   the sounds. And you just explore this giant art installation space and kind of learn about the
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:27.760]   lore, like the story behind this this imagined world, this alien world. There's lots of different
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:34.400]   rooms with different styles. Like one is very swampy, one is like a city. It's very cool. It
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.280]   was a lot to take in though like I was already really exhausted from the week. And I could only
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.360]   spend like a couple hours in there because it was constant sensory overload. But I would,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.200]   it was really cool. Like if anybody goes to Denver or another city that has a male wolf,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.480]   I think there are several. It's definitely an experience I've never been to an art installation
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:02.240]   that was quite like that. It sounds a little bit scary. Like almost like, I'm thinking almost
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.320]   like a haunted house kind of thing where you're like walking through this big area and it's like
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:12.000]   dark and desolate and like swampy. I don't know. Is it like frightening at all?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.120]   Some rooms like because it's supposed to be this alien landscape and this story about an alien
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:25.280]   society or something like that. Some of the rooms had these giant creatures or decorations
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.840]   on the wall like moving animatronic things. Some of them were really genuinely creepy.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.680]   Yeah. So some parts of it were haunted house like other parts were a little less frightening
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.240]   and more just like interesting and engaging and like, wow, this is kind of beautiful.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:50.800]   Cool. Okay. Meow Wolf. I'm going to Google it after our chat here and check out if there's any
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.440]   in my neck of the woods. I don't know if there will be any in Asia, but if there are, I'm going to
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:02.720]   add it to my to-do list because it sounds like a pretty interesting experience. Well, Indiana,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.280]   I think you must be pretty tired because like you said about the time zone change and then a
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:15.360]   wedding which is always a little bit exhausting to go to and participate in and then also a hike,
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:22.400]   drinking some beer and going through this intense art exhibition as well. It sounds like a very
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.280]   tiring trip. So I think this is a good place to wrap things up. We'll let you get some rest and
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:34.320]   readjust to your schedule back home, but thanks for telling us all about your trip. Absolutely.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:41.440]   Yeah, it was fun to reflect on it. You know, I don't keep a travel journal for most of my trips,
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.800]   but it's kind of a good idea because you get to really reflect on each thing that you did if you
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:53.120]   take the time to write out what happened. I would recommend that for anybody who tends to forget
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.400]   what they did on a nice trip or the highlights of where they visited. I think that or record a
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:05.680]   podcast about it. Yeah, that's a good idea too. Awesome. Well, guys, we're going to keep the
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:11.200]   conversation about this episode going over on our Discord community. So if you've ever visited
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.240]   Colorado and you have any memories that you'd like to share with everyone about your trip,
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.960]   that would be a good place to do it. Or if you have any questions or comments about this episode,
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.320]   you could leave them there as well and we'll try our best to answer them. And Indiana, maybe you
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:32.800]   could also share some of those photos from your trip in the Discord as well, just so our members
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.240]   over there can check them out because I think it would be great to see some visuals to kind of,
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.440]   yeah, just to see what it looks like in these landscapes that you were describing in this
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.800]   episode. So guys, go over to the Discord. It's free for everyone to join and we'll put the link
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:54.240]   to join the Discord in the description for this episode. And yeah, we'll continue the conversation
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.080]   over there. But as for now, that's it for us, everyone. So please take care and we'll catch you
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:06.400]   guys in the next Q loop episode. Until then, bye bye. Have a good one, everyone.
