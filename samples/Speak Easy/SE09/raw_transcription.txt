[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.880]   Hey everybody, my name is Andrew, and I'm Suzanne, and you're listening to Q-Lips.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.520]   Hey Suzanne, hey Andrew, how's it going?
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.480]   I'm doing pretty well Suzanne, and I'm happy to be back here today with you to do a brand
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.880]   new Speak Easy episode.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.040]   It's been a little while since our last Speak Easy episode, and for all of our listeners
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.200]   that don't know, this is the series where Suzanne, you teach us all about natural English pronunciation.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200]   Yes.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.360]   And what do you have planned for us today?
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:05.200]   Yes, well today, we're going to learn about when and how to make the flap sound in English,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.800]   the flap sound.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.440]   The flap sounds, okay.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.200]   Yeah, I'm not talking about a tap dancing step, even though that is also called a flap,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.000]   but this is something that has to do with your tongue.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.020]   I have the feeling that this is going to be brand new information for a lot of our listeners.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.440]   Maybe this sound, this flap sound, they've heard when they listen to English speakers
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.720]   talk, but maybe nobody has ever taught them about it directly.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.680]   So I think this is going to be a first for a lot of people.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.000]   So I'm excited about that.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.500]   Just before we get into all the nitty gritty of the flap sounds, I would like to remind
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.120]   all of our listeners that there is a study guide available for this episode, and it includes
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:15.640]   the transcript as well as some additional practice exercises for practicing the flap sound pronunciation.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.500]   Suzanne, you lovingly make these exercises for all of the study guide users.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.720]   There's some audio files that are included, some listen and repeat exercises.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.640]   Lots of good stuff is in the study guide.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.760]   So if you would like to study along with the guide, just visit our website, qlips.com,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:55.940]   and you can give it a download.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.120]   Let's start with a definition.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.080]   Suzanne, I think it's always a good place to start.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.560]   Could you give us a couple more details about what the flap is?
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:16.480]   Absolutely, so the flap is a sound that we hear quite often, and it's almost like a little
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.480]   tap that you do with your tongue on the top or roof of your mouth, right, your palate.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.840]   And it's usually in place of a T or a double T.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.240]   So when we have a T or two T's put together that are surrounded by vowel sounds, maybe
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.400]   in the middle of a word or even between word boundaries, like in between words, instead
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.360]   of pronouncing it like a T, we pronounce it with a light tap.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   So in the UK, for example, they might say a T sound, like letter, letter or better, right,
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.220]   in a UK pronunciation.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.200]   Or even they'll make a glottal sound in the back of their throat, a stop, right, like
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   a button.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   Totally.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.680]   They'll say, this is a bar, absolutely.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.840]   And it's not just in England, like in England, we have different accents in the UK and different
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.440]   British accents around the world that might do a different kind of a sound in that place.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.480]   But in North America, we make this little tap of the tongue on the roof of our mouth,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.720]   and that's called the flap.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:58.760]   Right, so to take those UK examples, you said that you might hear them say letter with
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.480]   like, yes, I can't do the accent very well.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   Letter.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   Letter.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   Letter, better.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   Yes.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.440]   But the two T's there are very strongly pronounced.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.640]   You can hear them very clearly.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:20.160]   Right, in North American English, or for the greater North American accent, the broad North
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   American accent.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.240]   We really soften those two T sounds.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.600]   We pronounce them with the flap, so it sounds more like letter or better.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.800]   Exactly.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.320]   And I think the misconception is that a lot of people think that it's a D, that it's a
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.680]   hard D sound, letter, better, but it's not quite a D.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.720]   And it's not quite what we would call an R, a reflexive R sound that we say in English.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.240]   So let's kind of go into how to make this, actually.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.200]   Yeah, good idea.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.280]   So everyone, put the tip of your tongue right behind your front teeth and sort of run into
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.320]   it back a little bit into the flat area right before the ridge.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.160]   And this is where we would make a right.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.400]   That's like just right behind the teeth, like a little bit, maybe like a few millimeters
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.840]   behind the teeth on that flat part.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.600]   And let's try sliding our tongue even further back to where it's sort of floating up in
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.600]   the middle of the mouth, pointing up toward the, toward the middle palette.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.800]   And we'll feel like this is an R sound, right?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.640]   R into the R zone.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.840]   Yeah, that's the R zone.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.840]   Sure.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:05.400]   Now, if we kind of split the difference in between there to where that ridgy part starts.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.160]   And it kind of starts to go up a little bit higher into the dome of the mouth.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.480]   This is where our flap is going to be.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.160]   This is where we're going to tap really, really lightly.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:26.680]   So a very delicate, delicate D, like you're barely touching the roof of your mouth.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.720]   And that's the R, R, R, R, R sound.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.880]   It almost has like a rolling R sound, right?
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.320]   Yeah, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, yeah, it's so strange.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.360]   It's very, very subtle, but it is there.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.680]   It's really subtle.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:56.680]   So right between the T, D area and the R area, so it's like right in between there.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.520]   And if you think about it, the flap is kind of like, has a little bit of percussive movement,
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:10.760]   like a T and a D, and a little bit of a vibration feeling, like an R. So it's kind of like they're
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.880]   coming together to make a new sound.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.040]   Okay, very good.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:25.200]   That's how we pronounce it, but how do we know when to pronounce the flap?
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.960]   And what context should we make this sound?
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.040]   Yeah, very good question.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:41.240]   So we usually make this flap sound whenever we encounter a T in the written English that's
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.600]   in between two vowels.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:52.920]   So for example, like we had in the beginning, we had letter, better, right?
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   Right.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:01.800]   The L, E, and then we have that T, and then another E, E, E, letter.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   Right.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.160]   Kind of a schwa, but yeah.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.120]   But it's in between two vowel sounds.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.280]   And so it becomes the flap.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   Now we can also have a T in between two vowel sounds in between words.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.640]   Like, do you ever say, like, get out of here?
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.640]   Right.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.480]   Not get out of here.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.640]   Get out of here.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   No way.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.640]   Right.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   Right.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:36.200]   Because, you know, technically written English and spacing between words, this is kind of
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.800]   an invention, right, in actual speech.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.880]   There's no space in between where one word stops and the other word begins.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:54.320]   So all of these pronunciation features are carried across words, aren't they?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   Yes.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.320]   Yes.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.000]   Because we don't say things in an isolated way.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Right.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.920]   We make it, we make a thought, right, we speak in thoughts.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.360]   And so not always in sentences, but more in thoughts.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:17.960]   And our thoughts kind of run together to make it cohesive, to make it make sense.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.800]   And that causes our mouth to blend the words into each other.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:32.320]   And this is a something that we could add in between those words, for example, get out
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   of here, right?
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.080]   Get out of here.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.160]   So I have two flaps there.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.840]   Get out, get out, get out.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.400]   That's really an important point, I think, that you just made because as our listeners
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:57.120]   will probably know, the word get, the verb get is super, super common in English.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   Right.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.440]   And it's used as a phrasal verb in so many different contexts with different prepositions
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.040]   and particles that often start with a vowel, right?
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.160]   Get out, get up, get around, get in, get under.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.760]   And so in all of these contexts, you're going to hear that flap sound.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   Yes.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   Exactly.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:29.400]   And all of those phrasal verb be kind of combos, that kind of compound verb, and if it ends
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.720]   with a T, absolutely, put on, put up, right?
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:43.160]   It's going to have that T between two vowel sounds, like you said, because it's usually
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.880]   starting with a vowel sound on your preposition.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:54.360]   And then it will make you create that flap sound in there with that T.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   Exactly.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.160]   You know, there's a funny example that comes to mind when I think of the flap.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.000]   And that's from a podcast that I sometimes listen to.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.880]   It's a Canadian podcast called Quirks and Quirks.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.280]   And it's all about science.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.880]   And at the end of the show, the host, who is an older gentleman, he's probably in his
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   60s.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:26.400]   And I don't think he's really up to date with current pronunciation of social media.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:34.640]   He always says, all right, listeners, you can find us on Twitter, Twitter, Twitter,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   Twitter.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.920]   And actually, nobody around me, none of my friends say Twitter.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920]   Everybody says Twitter.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.240]   We use the flatter Twitter.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   So.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   Yep.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:52.880]   And but you hit on something very interesting because in, I would say because of the influence
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:02.600]   the UK has on Canada, there tends to be maybe in the older generations a little bit more
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.560]   of an essence of British pronunciation.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   Yes.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:15.960]   It is maybe where they, they might emulate or mimic that pronunciation.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:23.680]   Bring that out more because it's, it's really, um, you know, if they were to say letter with
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.360]   the dropped R, it's a little or Twitter, it's a little bit weird.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:35.320]   But just saying the T's makes it a little bit of both in a way.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.800]   That's a great point.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:46.240]   And to be honest, my mom will actually pronounce the T's a full T sound in many of these words.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:54.880]   It's better to go to the market than to go to the shopping mall or write a letter to
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.280]   your sister.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:03.080]   And she has actually brought it up with me before saying, Andrew, it's not letter.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.320]   It's a letter, you know, she tried to correct my pronunciation about this.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:15.120]   And I had to argue with her a little bit and say, no, mom, this is how we talk in Canada.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.000]   This is how we young and talk.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.240]   This is how, yeah, the current generation talk.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.800]   So that's a generational gap and yeah, but also for our listeners, just so they know it's
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:35.480]   not wrong if they hear both, but they can choose what they want to do going forward.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:42.280]   If they want to do the flap or try it out in some cases, maybe, you know, at the coffee
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:49.440]   shop or in study sessions, try out the flap, but know that you're going to hear a few different
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:57.480]   versions and none of them are wrong.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:05.840]   Those are all three native speaker ways of saying that word, so totally.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:13.360]   But I would say just as an addendum to that, that the flap that we're talking about today
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.440]   is the most common North America.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.400]   So that's the one you'll hear the most.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.000]   Should we try some examples?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.560]   We've got a couple of examples prepared here for everyone.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.240]   So let's listen to example number one.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.920]   Hey, Betty, where'd you put that letter I got yesterday?
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.120]   I think I put it on the metal table.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.000]   Oh, great, thanks.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.960]   All right.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.680]   And now let's listen to that example one more time, except this time it slowed down a little
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   bit.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:55.900]   Hey, Betty, where did you put that letter I got yesterday?
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.560]   I think I put it on the metal table.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.080]   Oh, great.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   Thanks.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:12.040]   Suzanne, which words did you hear in that example that demonstrated the flap sound?
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.000]   Betty, right?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Betty.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.720]   Yeah, because the spelling is B-E-T-T-Y, but we don't say Betty.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.920]   We say Betty, Betty, no, Betty.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.000]   And also letter, like we said before, letter.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.920]   Letter, yeah.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:41.600]   And also yesterday, yesterday, now the thing here is this is a D. It's between an R and
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.680]   a vowel.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:52.160]   But if you remember what I said, this, first of all, is the unstressed syllable, day is
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.160]   not stressed.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.080]   You don't say yesterday.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   You say yesterday.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   Yesterday.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:06.120]   First of all, and second of all, you can make that a flap because the R is kind of pulling
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.960]   that D a little bit back into the inside of your mouth.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:19.880]   And so sometimes if you say it fast, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, your tongue will actually
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.080]   make a flap sound, not a D.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   Okay.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:29.360]   That's a little bit more complex, but I just wanted people to kind of see it, be aware
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.800]   of that, and be like, oh, yeah, I do hear that.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   Right.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.120]   Yeah, I hear it as well, but you're totally right.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.600]   It doesn't come to the forefront of my mind when I think of this flap sound.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   Yeah, I wouldn't have anticipated it to be in that word, but there it is.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.040]   Yeah, just something to think about.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.080]   Suzanne, let's listen to the second example.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   Okay.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:02.200]   Oh, my gosh, Maddie was going on and on about that peanut butter.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   I know.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.680]   He was like, da, da, da, da, da, da, this peanut butter is the best nut butter ever.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.480]   Yeah, I hated it.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.680]   I thought I was going to go out of my mind.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.720]   And now let's listen to it one more time, a little slower.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:28.960]   Oh, my gosh, Maddie was going on and on about that peanut butter.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.920]   I know he was like, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, this peanut butter is the
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.360]   best nut butter ever.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.120]   Yeah, I hated it.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.720]   I thought I was going to go out of my mind.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.960]   Okay, Sue.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.920]   So I heard another few examples of the flap.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:01.640]   And the first one is with the name, again, just like Betty, this time we had Maddie was
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.640]   one of the characters, Maddie.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:11.720]   So M-A-T-T-Y, but those two T's are sandwiched in between two vowel sounds.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.880]   So we actually pronounce them as a flap, Maddie.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.920]   Yes.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.040]   And also one of my favorite foods, peanut butter.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.040]   Me too.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.720]   Oh, my gosh, me too.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   Ah, love it.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   Love it.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.220]   Peanut butter.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:34.680]   Now there was an interesting turn of phrase that came out that appeared in this example,
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.160]   da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.160]   totally.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.480]   What's going on there?
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:49.080]   I used this little thing here because I think if you guys need a way to practice the flap,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:55.120]   this is a great way to practice it by doing this kind of turn of phrase.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:03.120]   In this example, we have a character who is like explaining how their friend went on
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.720]   and on and on about this peanut butter.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:14.240]   So a way of doing that, a way of explaining how people talk a lot about a topic is you
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.400]   can say, yeah, and he was like, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, blah,
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.120]   blah, blah, blah, blah, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   da, da, da, da, da.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   Exactly.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.840]   This is a way of explaining that they're talking a lot about something.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:35.160]   So this is also a great way to practice the flap because our tongue is moving in and out
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.560]   of that little area where we make the flap sound.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.880]   So I thought it was a funny thing to put in there.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.880]   I love it.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.880]   I love it.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.200]   We also have the example of hated it, hated, hated it.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   Wow.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   Hated it.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.880]   There's another multi-word example.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.880]   Exactly.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:04.840]   And also out of, right, out of my mind, out of, we have that as well.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   I was going to go out of my mind, out of my mind.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.720]   This is an idiom, actually, too, right?
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   It sort of means that you're going to go crazy.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   Something's driving you crazy.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   Yes.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   It's really irritating and annoying.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   Yes.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.720]   Lose my mind.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.720]   Lose my mind.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   I could see that if somebody was going on and on about peanut butter or that, it might
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.120]   be boring to listen to, even though I love it.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.000]   Who wants to listen to somebody talk about peanut butter for a long time, though?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Not me.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:46.920]   So, Sue, just before we wrap it up, I thought it would be useful to give our listeners some
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:53.800]   more examples of words where they can hear the flap sound and to demonstrate the pronunciation
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.600]   for everyone.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.000]   So do you have any words in mind that you could share with us?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.320]   Well, one thing that you'll come into contact with quite often is the spelling T with an
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   ING.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:17.760]   So if you have a root word that ends with a T like meat and then you add an ING at the
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:26.440]   end, meeting, this is going to instead be, instead of being meeting, you'll say, meeting,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:33.920]   er, er, er, er, meeting, ring, so it's kind of that flap into the ING.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.920]   Okay.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.920]   So like meeting, meeting.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   Yes.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   Meeting.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.800]   Letting or fitting or hating.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   Okay.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.240]   These are all examples of T-I-N-G.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.400]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.320]   Because this is one of the ways that we can make nouns in English is by adding this ING
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:04.600]   and since the I is a vowel, then you're going to get a lot of cases where the T that ends
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:10.240]   the word is now sandwiched in between two vowel sounds when you add the ING there.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.400]   Well, that's really interesting.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.520]   I never noticed that before.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:23.120]   And this also happens in some cases too with simple past like visited, instead of visited,
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:32.000]   you might say visited, visited, you might turn that T into a flap or wanted.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.320]   So sometimes that T at the end of the word can change into a flap.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.600]   Okay.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:46.360]   And everyone though will be a lot more examples and practice exercises in the study guide for
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.480]   this episode.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.520]   So this is definitely something you'll want to download.
