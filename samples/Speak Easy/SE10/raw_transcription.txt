[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.400]   Hey everybody, my name is Andrew, and I'm Suzanne, and you're listening to QLips.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:25.840]   Hi guys, welcome back to episode number 10 of Speak Easy, our pronunciation series.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:35.320]   I am joined today by QLips, resident pronunciation expert Suzanne, hey Suzanne, how are you?
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.760]   Hey Andrew, I'm doing pretty good, how are you?
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.680]   I am doing very well myself, thank you, and Suzanne, today we have one of my favorite
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.640]   kind of episodes, and this is when we get to answer a listener's question.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.240]   We recently received a very interesting question from one of our listeners named Tatiana,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:11.360]   who was confused about some words that sound very similar, because they have similar vowel
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360]   sounds.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.680]   Yes.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.960]   When words have almost exactly the same sound overall, but there's one little tiny difference,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.440]   we call this a minimal pair.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.840]   Yeah, so for example, pit and bit are minimal pairs, because they're very similar, but
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.560]   there's just one thing that's slightly different.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:44.880]   So exactly, a minimal pair is when a pair of words differ only by just one sound.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.360]   Usually that sound is in the same position of the word as well.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.240]   Yes, exactly.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.880]   So the words are almost exactly similar, but at the same point in both words, one sound
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   is different.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   Yes.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.320]   This is a minimal pair, and today we are going to take a look at some of the minimal pairs
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.400]   that Tatiana mentioned are difficult for her to hear.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.080]   So that's the plan for today, but just before we get into it in more depth, Suzanne, I did
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   want to remind everyone that the best way to study along with today's episode is with
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.080]   the study guide, and you can download it from our website, qlibs.com.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.240]   You'll find the transcript in the study guide, and you'll find bonus practice exercises that
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.200]   you can use to study these minimal pairs that we'll look at today.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.160]   And we think it would be really helpful for you, Suzanne, you actually designed the study
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.240]   guide with love for all of our listeners.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.080]   So if you want to check it out, guys, just visit qlibs.com to download it.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.120]   Okay, so let's get into it.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.200]   So what are some of these words that Tatiana had a problem with?
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.040]   So first, we're just going to say them so that you can see if you can perceive or hear
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.960]   the difference in the vowel sounds between each word that, you know, they'll sound similar,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.520]   but they'll be one thing that's a little different.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.840]   And then let's get into some nitty gritty ones.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.000]   We'll really look into it and see if we can figure out how to make them different and
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.360]   why they're different.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360]   Okay.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.360]   Sounds good.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.880]   So Sue, why don't you read them for us?
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.860]   So the first pair is hustle and hassle.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.860]   Hustle, hassle.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.860]   Yes.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.860]   Good.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.160]   The second pair is reword and reward.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:08.680]   The third pair is wander and wonder, wander and wonder.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.280]   Wonder, wonder, wonder.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   Good.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.040]   The next one is stuff and staff.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.560]   Stuff, staff.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.920]   Yes.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.360]   The next one is very and very.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.240]   Very, very.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.240]   Cool.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.440]   So that's a tough one.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.600]   To me, they sound almost identical.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.000]   When you say them, Suzanne, I hear a difference.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.400]   When I say them, they sound the same.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.960]   So maybe this is a slight issue in the accents that are different between us too.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.880]   Actually, what you're doing is Canadian rising.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.600]   So Canada has a little bit different of an accent where the tongue will actually go higher
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.000]   for certain sounds, especially vowels.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.120]   And this is an example.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:14.160]   So instead of saying very, very, very, you're saying very, very, very, so that air is a
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.800]   little bit higher.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   That's all.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.040]   It's the tongue is a bit higher up in an arch.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.240]   It's my Canadianism coming out.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   It's okay.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   That's all good.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   As long as it's, I mean, most of these, you kind of know what they are when they're
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.760]   in context, right?
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.840]   You wouldn't say it varies and then think it's very, you wouldn't say it varies.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.520]   Very is not that son of word, varies, right?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.240]   So you would know that it's the second one, that it's very, very interestingly, when I
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.560]   say this word in its different forms, like variation, then I think I hear the vowel that
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.920]   you use come out more.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:06.080]   So in the shortened vary, then it's a little less significant, a little less noticeable.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.920]   And I think that that's because Canadians tend to clipboards or say them faster than Americans
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   do.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.760]   So Americans are going to really elongate and sort of like make vowels longer and a little
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:28.720]   bit more stressed, so I might say vary and really like get my mouth around that whole
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.880]   diphthong, whereas Canadians might say vary, vary, like a quicker vowel.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.280]   And that's cool.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   That's okay.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.760]   The context will really help us know what you're trying to say.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   So let's just get through the last three of these pairs.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.760]   Okay.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:07:00.600]   So the next set is bold, bold, which is like, you know, like a bold colour or bald, bald.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:13.440]   So you have bow and bow, bold and bald, bold, bald, bald, yeah, that can be a little tricky,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:21.520]   but it's really, you have to be more precise with that, oh sound, bold and bald, bold,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.440]   bold, bald, yeah.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:31.880]   Then our next one is taxes, like we pay taxes and taxis.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:40.360]   So we have taxes, it's an I sound or an S sound, whichever you want, you choose to do.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.440]   A shorter vowel sound.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.280]   Yeah, some people make it a schwa or an uh, and some people make it an I tend to make
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:57.120]   it an I whenever you have an ES sound as, I usually say is taxes, taxes, me as well.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.040]   Yeah, that's more North American.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.880]   And if you're in the UK, it's also correct, but it's just a different sound.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.440]   They might say taxes, taxes, so it's going to be an uh sound.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.720]   So taxis, that last syllable is an E sound, right?
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:24.920]   Taxi, E, mmm, taxis, taxis, talking about like taxi cabs, like taxis, taxis.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.240]   And then our last one is warrior and warrior.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.360]   So when I say it, for me, they are actually homonyms, so they sound the same.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.880]   They just mean two different things.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:48.320]   Right, so a warrior is someone that fights, a warrior, like a soldier, and a warrior is
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.920]   someone who worries a lot, frets a lot.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.280]   And Suzanne, you just mentioned that when I say these, I actually say them differently,
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   right?
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.720]   Warrior, warrior, warrior, and that's my Canadian accent coming out again.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.000]   But for you, when you say them, with your American accent, they are homophones, they
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.400]   are the same sound.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   Yes.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.760]   So it's really, it's really, again, they're very different meanings.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.080]   They have very different meanings.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.600]   So you're going to know what we're talking about in context, right?
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.680]   Almost opposite meanings when you think about it.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.800]   A warrior is somebody in battle who's very brave and a warrior would be maybe somebody
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.960]   who stays home and friends.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   Mm hmm.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.560]   Totally, totally different.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:48.280]   And then our listener Tatiana also wrote in sun, S-O-N, and sun, S-U-N.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.800]   But those are also homonyms or homophone sounds.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:59.400]   So they are actually pronounced exactly the same and mean two different things, right?
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.240]   One is a boy.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.640]   A male child.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   Yep.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.120]   And one is the burning star in the sky that keeps us warm.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   The sun.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   So.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.120]   Like alive, yes.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.120]   Excited.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.120]   Shout out to the sun.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.120]   What's up, son?
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.360]   Grew my plants.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   Yes.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   Mm hmm.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   Exactly.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   So those are actually supposed to be the same, sun.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   That's the same.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   Yep.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.600]   Those are exactly the same for every variation of English.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   Exactly.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600]   Exactly.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   It doesn't matter where you're from.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.040]   Um, it always sounds the same.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.680]   So we're just going to leave that one out.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   Great.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.080]   So we have several examples of different minimal pairs here.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:49.120]   And Suzanne, now I think it would be great if we took an in-depth look at these pairs
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.840]   and talk about them a little bit more in greater detail.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.960]   So the first set is hustle, hassle.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.560]   So I hear that the vowel is different in these two.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   Right.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:10.400]   When you say the words, what do you feel you're doing with your mouth?
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.320]   That's different in each in each word when you say them.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:21.560]   Let me say them again here, hustle, hassle, hustle, hassle.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:31.840]   So when I say hassle, I notice that my jaw opens wider.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   Right.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   Yes.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.840]   Right.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   So you're, you're allowing more space into your mouth when you say that, ah, sound, huh,
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.120]   huh, huh, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:50.720]   I can really notice that my mouth is opening more hustle, hassle.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:58.880]   And what's happening with your lips when you say the sound, are they like relaxed down?
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.360]   Are they retracted?
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.920]   Are they little smiling?
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   Hmm.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   Interesting.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   Hustle, hassle.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.280]   Feels like I'm almost turning them inwards.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.600]   So they're more retracted.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.280]   So they're kind of when, when we say retracted, we kind of mean that they are smiling a little
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.280]   bit.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   Right.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.800]   If there's a bit more of a pull of the muscles that are pulling them back and opening your
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.080]   mouth, ha, ha, hassle, they're definitely tighter.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.160]   Hustle, the lips are totally relaxed and hassle.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.320]   There's some tension on my lips.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.800]   We, we would call this a retraction or a slight smile because even though your jaws open, your
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.660]   lips are, if you closed your, if you say ha and then close your jaw, guess what you'd
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.660]   have?
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.660]   I would be smiling.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.660]   You'd be smiling.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.660]   Exactly.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.660]   Right.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.680]   So that is what we would call a, use a bit of a smile, drop your jaw more and you will
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.960]   have the right sound for hassle, hassle.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:13.820]   With ha, hustle, this is a more mid vowel, whereas a is a more forward vowel.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:21.080]   That just means the tongue is arching more forward for the a and more mid for the a and
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:27.960]   you're relaxing your jaw to be not so open and your lips are not smiling at all.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.120]   They're just hanging there at your face, like just, just neutral.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:42.000]   So it's ha, ha, just like you're saying the or cup or, I don't know, dumb, dumb.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.760]   I don't know, I couldn't think of a word.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.200]   So this is ha, hustle, hustle.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   Okay.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   Okay.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.360]   And just in case some of our listeners are not familiar with the meaning of these two
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:03.240]   words, I suppose we should explain them something that is a hassle is something that's annoying
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.400]   and bothersome and something that you don't really want to do, right?
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.280]   Like, I don't know, going to the dentist could be a hassle, right?
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.920]   It's annoying or like the post office or going to the post office.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:26.120]   Something is just gets in the way of your regular schedule and hustle means to work quickly
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.000]   or to move quickly, right?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.720]   We hear this a lot like a coach, a basketball coach might yell at his players to hustle.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.960]   Show me some hustle.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.240]   Show me some quick movement, some action, some bigger.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   You could use it too.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.780]   Like I've been hustling or, you know, I had to hustle all over the city today, like
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:52.280]   I had to run here and run there and run over all over the place, right?
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.720]   This to be, we even use hustle to mean like, to be a good business person, right?
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.560]   If you've been hustling, maybe you hear this used in rap songs a lot, right?
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:11.360]   Like hustling means selling something, selling rap albums or other things.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.360]   Totally.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   All right.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:21.880]   All right, Sue, let's keep going on with the next set that we'll look at for today and
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:28.160]   that is reward and reward, reward, reward.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   So reward means to write something using different words, right?
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.920]   If you don't like the original wording of the sentence that you wrote, then you could
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:46.560]   change the words and this is to reward and reward.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.280]   This is, well, if you win a prize or maybe you find somebody's lost cat, they will give
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.840]   you a reward, right?
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:04.040]   The vowels in these two words are a little bit more complex because reward is a vowel
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:15.200]   that is always paired with an R. It's the er vowel like in the word word or bird or stir.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.040]   It's an er vowel.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   It's kind of a weird, it's one of the strangest vowels that we have in phonetics and in the
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:30.000]   English language, but it is a vowel sound, but it is a pure vowel sound because we're
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.560]   not moving.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:40.240]   Your mouth stays still and it makes a pure sound, er, that's for reward.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:48.080]   And then for the second word, we actually have a diphthong as the vowel sound.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.680]   Okay, and could you just quickly explain what a diphthong is?
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:17:03.880]   Yeah, so a diphthong is actually when two vowels come together to make one vowel sound
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.920]   and we have a bunch of those in English.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:18.440]   For example, like pay, we have an E, pay, we have time, I, right, ah, and E, time, right?
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.880]   Okay, so it's when you're transitioning between kind of two vowel sounds, right?
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   Totally.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.880]   Yes.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:33.160]   Pay is E, right, E, E, and I is A, E, yeah.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:42.120]   So in reward, we have what we call a diphthong of R. So we have four diphthongs of R in English.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:56.440]   We have here, ear, air, or, and R. So in this one, we're using the or, reward, right, the
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.080]   or sound.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.960]   Why are they called diphthongs of R?
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.480]   Well, it's just because when you're making an R sound, a little extra vowel happens and
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:12.040]   a sound, we go or, or, right, reward.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:20.560]   So in this case, we're moving our lips as we say this vowel, which is different than the
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.240]   first word that we're looking at.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.880]   The first one we don't, it's a pure vowel, our lips and our mouth stay still.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.960]   So it's reword and in the second one, we're moving our lips and we're going to move our
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.540]   lips really forward, really, really round them forward.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.360]   Like you're saying, ooh, let me go reward.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   Reward.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.200]   Yeah, it's totally true.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:53.800]   So that's why it's a little bit complex because, you know, those are not really common vowel
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.240]   sounds, but that's what makes them different.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:05.560]   Okay, so one more time, just so our listeners can hear the difference, it's reword, reward.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.080]   So in reword, you're not really moving, right?
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.600]   You're just keeping your jaw still.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.960]   You're saying reword.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.960]   And then word.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   Yes.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.240]   And in the second one, we're opening our jaw more and we're pushing our lips forward.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.800]   Like we're about to say, ooh, and we say, reward, reward.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.760]   So we go really forward, wah, and we open our jaw.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.760]   Well, Suzanne, that was a very detailed and nice explanation.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.560]   Listeners, maybe you can tell that I'm also learning a lot of things from the Speak Easy
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:50.800]   series because, you know, I teach grammar, I teach vocabulary, I do a lot of teaching
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.520]   regarding English, but I don't teach much pronunciation.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:02.240]   And so, Suzanne, I always love listening to these episodes so I can level up my English
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.040]   pronunciation knowledge too.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.340]   Anytime, Andrew.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:21.040]   Well, Tatiana, thank you very much for your question.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:28.360]   It was a really good one and we don't have time today, Sue, to look at all of the distinctions
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.640]   that Tatiana asked us about.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.320]   But hey, maybe in the next episode, we could take a look at some more of these minimal
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   pairs.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.520]   Sounds good.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.420]   All right, well, thank you, everyone, for listening.
