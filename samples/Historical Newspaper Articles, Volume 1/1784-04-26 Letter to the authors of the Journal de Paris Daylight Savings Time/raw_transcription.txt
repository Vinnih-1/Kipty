[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:20.160]   Benjamin Franklin led it to the editor, Journal de Paris, April 26, 1784.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.400]   Read by M.L. Cohen Cleveland, Ohio, March 2007.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.180]   This year, you often entertain us with accounts of new discoveries.
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.800]   Permit me to communicate to the public, through your paper, one that has lately been made by
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.720]   myself, and which I conceive may be of great utility.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.560]   I was the other evening in a grand company, where the new lamp of Messier's Kincai and
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.840]   Lang was introduced, and much admired for its splendor.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.360]   But a general inquiry was made whether the oil it consumed was not in proportion to the
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.400]   light it afforded, in which case there would be no saving in the use of it.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.000]   No one present can satisfy us in that point, which all agreed ought to be known, it being
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.960]   a very desirable thing to lessen, if possible, the expense of lighting our apartments, when
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.240]   every other article of family expense was so much augmented.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.200]   I was pleased to see this general concern for the economy, for I loved the economy exceedingly.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.720]   I went home, and to bed, three or four hours after midnight, with my head full of the subject.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.320]   An accidental sudden noise waked me about six in the morning, when I was surprised to find
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.680]   my room filled with light.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.160]   And I imagined at first, that a number of those lamps had been brought into it, but
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.200]   rubbing my eyes, I perceived the light came in at the windows.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.880]   I got up and looked out to see what might be the occasion of it, when I saw the sun just
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.720]   rising above the horizon, from whence he poured his rays plentiful into my chamber, my domestic
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.840]   having negligently omitted the preceding evening to close the shutters.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.240]   I looked at my watch, which goes very well, and found that it was but six o'clock.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.640]   And still thinking it's something extraordinary that the sun should rise so early, I looked
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.440]   into the almanac, where I found it to be the hour given for his rising on that day.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.120]   I looked forward, too, and found he was to rise still earlier every day till towards
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.320]   the end of June, and that at no time in the year he retarded his rising so long as till
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.920]   eight o'clock.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.080]   Your readers, who with me have never seen any signs of sunshine before noon, and seldom
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.560]   regard the astronomical part of the almanac, will be as much astonished as I was when
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.160]   they hear of his rising so early, and especially when I assure them that he gives light as
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.480]   soon as he rises.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.400]   I am convinced of this, I am certain of my fact, one cannot be more certain of any fact,
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.280]   I saw it with my own eyes.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.960]   And having repeated this observation the three following mornings, I found always precisely
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.080]   the same result.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.120]   Yet it so happens that when I speak of this discovery to others, I can easily perceive
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.200]   by their countences, though they for bear expressing it in words, that they do not quite
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.520]   believe me.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.600]   One indeed, who is a learned natural philosopher, has assured me that I must certainly be mistaken
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.240]   as to the circumstance of light coming into my room.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.680]   For it being well known, as he says, that there could be no light abroad at that hour,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.840]   it follows that none could enter from without, and that, of consequence, my windows being
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.720]   accidentally left open, instead of letting in the light, had only served to let out the
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.840]   darkness.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.960]   And he used many ingenious arguments to show me how I might, by that means, have been deceived.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.120]   I own that he puzzled me a little, but he did not satisfy me, and the subsequent observations
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.480]   I made, as above mentioned, confirmed me in my first opinion.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.440]   This event has given rise in my mind to several serious and important reflections.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.960]   I considered that, if I had not been awakened so early in the morning, I should have slept
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.920]   six hours longer by the light of the sun, and in exchange have lived six hours the following
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.120]   night by candlelight; and, the latter being a much more expensive light than the former,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.720]   my love of economy induced me to muster up what little arithmetic I was master of, and
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.800]   to make some calculations, which I shall give you, after observing that utility is, in my
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.560]   opinion, the test of value in matters of invention, and that a discovery which can be applied
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.080]   to no use, or is not good for something, is good for nothing.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.120]   I took for the basis of my calculation the supposition that there are 100,000 families
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.080]   in Paris, and that these families consume in the night half a pound of boogies or candles
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.880]   per hour.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.240]   I think this is a moderate allowance, taking one family with another; for though I believe
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.240]   some consume less I know that many consume a great deal more.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.200]   Then estimating seven hours per day as the medium quantity, between the time of the sun's rising
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.440]   in hours, he rising during the six following months from six to eight hours before noon,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.560]   and there being seven hours of course per night in which we burn candles, the account
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.640]   will stand thus.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.080]   In the six months between the 20th of March and the 20th of September, there are nights
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.280]   183, hours of each night in which we burn candles, seven.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.880]   Multiplication gives for the total number of hours 1,281.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:57.040]   These 1,281 hours multiplied by 100,000, the number of inhabitants, gives 128,100,000.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.520]   128,000 and 100,000 hours spent at Paris by candlelight, which, at half a pound of wax
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:11.000]   and tallow per hour, gives the weight of 64,050,000.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.320]   Four millions and 50,000 of pounds, which, estimating the whole at the median price of
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:28.520]   30 soles the pound, makes the sum of 96,000,75,000 leavers tor nois, colon 96,000,75,000,
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.000]   and immense sum that the city of Paris might save each year by the economy of using sunshine
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.240]   instead of candles.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.400]   If it should be said that people are apt to be obstinately attached to old customs, and
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.640]   that it will be difficult to induce them the rise before noon, consequently my discovery
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.400]   can be of little use.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.080]   I answer nil disparatum.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.200]   I believe all who have common sense, as soon as they have learned from this paper that
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.640]   it is daylight when the sun rises, will contrive to rise with him, and to compel the rest I
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.200]   would propose the following regulations.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.160]   First, let a tax be laid of a Lewis per window on every window that is provided with shutters
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.840]   to keep out the light of the sun.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.360]   Second, let the same dietary operation of police be made use of to prevent our burning
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.720]   candles, then inclined us last winter to be more economical and burning wood.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   That is, let guards be placed in the shops of the wax and tallow chandlers, and no family
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.040]   be permitted to be supplied with more than one pound of candles per week.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.960]   Third, let guards also be posted to stop all the coaches, etc. that would pass the streets
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.520]   after sunset, except those of physicians, surgeons, and midwives.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.320]   Fourth, every morning, as soon as the sun rises, let all the bells in every church be set ringing,
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.920]   and if that is not sufficient, let a cannon be fired in every street to wake the sluggers
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.520]   effectually, and to make them open their eyes to see their true interest.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.680]   All the difficulty will be in the first two or three days, after which the reformation
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:14.360]   will be as natural and as easy as the present irregularity, for senesquilé prémue apacacout,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.000]   oblige a man to rise at four in the morning, and it is more than probable he will go willingly
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.640]   to bed at eight in the evening, and, having had eight hours of sleep, he will rise more
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.280]   willingly at four in the morning following.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.720]   But this sum of ninety-six million and seventy-five thousand leavers is not the whole of what
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.920]   may be saved by my economical project.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.520]   You may observe that I have calculated upon only one half of the year, and much may be
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.960]   saved in the other, though the days are shorter.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.720]   Besides, the immense stock of wax and tallot left unconsumed during the summer will probably
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.780]   make candles much cheaper for the ensuing winter, and continue them cheaper as long as the proposed
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.440]   reformation shall be supported.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.600]   For the great benefit of this discovery, thus freely communicated and bestowed by me and
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:11.000]   the public, I demand neither place, pension, exclusive privilege, nor any reward whatever.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.120]   I expect only to have the honour of it.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.720]   And yet I know there are little envious minds who will as usual deny me this and say that
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.160]   my invention was known to the ancients, and perhaps they may bring passages out of the
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.840]   old books and proof of it.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.760]   I will not dispute with these people, that the ancients knew not the sun would rise at
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.280]   certain hours.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.800]   They possibly had, as we have, almanacs that predicted it.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.840]   But it does not follow thence that they knew he gave light as soon as he rose.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.520]   This is what I claim as my discovery.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.200]   If the ancients knew it, it might have been long since forgotten, for it certainly was
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.480]   unknown to the moderns, at least to the Parisians, which to prove I need but one plain, simple
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   argument.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.400]   They are as well instructed, judicious, and prudent of people as exist anywhere in the
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.200]   world all professing, like myself, to be lovers of economy.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   And from the many heavy taxes required from them by the necessities of the state have
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   surely an abundant reason to be economical.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.520]   I say it is impossible that so sensible a people, under such circumstances, should have
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.280]   lived so long by the smoky, unwholesome, and enormously expensive light of candles,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.240]   if they had really known that they might have had as much pure light of the sun for
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.240]   nothing.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:39.840]   I am, et cetera, a subscriber, signed, Benjamin Franklin.
