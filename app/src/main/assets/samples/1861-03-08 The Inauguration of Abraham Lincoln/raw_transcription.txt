[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]   The inauguration of Abraham Lincoln from the farmer's cabinet.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.000]   Friday, March the 8th, 1861, read for Liberbox.org by Karen Savage.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.500]   Washington, March 4th.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:27.000]   The day was ushered in by a most exciting session of the Senate, that body sitting for 12 hours, from 7 o'clock yesterday evening to 7 o'clock this morning.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   As the hands of the clock pointed to 12 o'clock last night, and the Sabbath gave way to Monday the 4th of March, the Senate chamber presented a curious and animated appearance.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   The galleries were crowded to repletion, the ladies gallery resembling from the gay dresses of the fair ones they are congregated, some gorgeous parterra of flowers.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And the gentleman's gallery seemed one dense black mass of surging, heaving masculine, pushing, struggling, and almost clambering over each other's backs in order to get a good look at the proceedings.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Some most ludicrous scenes were the result of the intense desire of the outsiders to get a peep into the Senate chamber, and the pertinacity with which the applicant for admission to the overflowing galleries would urge that he had come all the way from Indiana or Varmont, or some other place afforded the seat.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   On the floor, Messier's Crittenden, Trumbull, Wickfall, Wade, Douglas, and others, kept up a rolling fire of debate, while those not engaged in the discussion, betook themselves to the sofas for a comfortable nap during the session, which it was known would last all night.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   As the morning advanced, the galleries and floor became gradually cleared out, when in the gray morning light the Senate took a recess till ten o'clock today.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   A few minutes after seven o'clock, but few remained.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The morning broke clear and beautiful, and though at one time a few drops of rain fell, the day proved just calm and cloudy enough to prevent the usual heat of the past few days, and the whirlwind of dust that would otherwise render it excessively unpleasant.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   The public buildings, schools, places of business, etc., were closed throughout the day.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   The stars and stripes floated from the city hall, capital, board apartment, and other public buildings, while not a few of the citizens flung out flags from their houses or across the principal avenues.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   From early dawn the Drummond Five could be heard in every quarter of the city, and the streets were thronged with volunteer soldiers hastening to their respective rendezvous.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Three or four hours elapsed before there was the least chance of entering the capital.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Pennsylvania Avenue was thronged with people, winding their way to the famous East Front.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   For four hours the crowd poured on toward the capital in one continuous stream of old and young, male and female,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   stayed old Quakers from Pennsylvania going to see Friend Abraham, and lengthy suckers, Hoosiers and Wolverines, desirous of a peep at Mr. Lincoln, Buckeyes and Yankees, men from the northeast and the northwest, and a few from the border states.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   The large majority, however, were northern men, there being but few southerners, judging from the lack of long-haired men in the crowd.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   The order of arrangements, as settled by the Committee of Arrangements, was as follows.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   To the left of the Vice President were the Committee of Arrangements, immediately behind them the heads of the various departments of the government.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Senators and members elect of the House of Representatives, Officers of the Army and Navy, Governors of the States and Territories, Comptrollers, Auditors, registers and solicitors of the Treasury.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   To the right of the Vice President were the Judges of the Supreme Court, Senators, Diplomatic Corps, Ex-Governors of States, Assistant Secretaries of Departments, Commissioners, Judges and Mayors of Georgetown and Washington.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Previous to the arrival of the procession, the Senate chamber did not present a very animated appearance. The many ladies waiting to see the display did not arrive till late, and the officers whose gay uniforms and flashing epulets relieved so well the somberness of the National Black were with the Presidential Cortege during the passing of the procession to Willard's Hotel and the march thence to the Capitol.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Senator Bright killed in the most approved manner a certain gas bill to wit by talking it to death. This not proving very interesting matters waxed somewhat dull in the interim.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   At five minutes to twelve o'clock, Vice President Breckenridge and Senator Foote of the Committee of Arrangements entered the Senate chamber, escorting the Vice President-elect Honorable Hannibal Hamlin, whom they conducted to a seat immediately to the left of the chair of the President of the Senate.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   As the hands of the clock pointed to the hour of twelve, the hammer fell and the second session of the 36th Congress came to an end.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Vice President Breckenridge bid the Senate farewell and then administered the oath of office to Vice President Hamlin. This ceremony is described in the Senate report.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Mr. Breckenridge then announced the Senate adjourned without day and left the chair to which he immediately conducted Vice President Hamlin.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Honorable Mr. Klingman was then sworn in as Senator from the State of North Carolina, Messier's Clark for New Hampshire, Chase for Ohio, Harris of New York, Harlan for Iowa, Howe for Wisconsin, Breckenridge for Kentucky, Lane for Indiana, Nesmith for Oregon, and Mitchell for Arkansas.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   At this juncture, the members and members elect of the House of Representative entered the Senate chamber, filling every available place to the left of the Vice President.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   The foreign diplomatic corps also entered the chamber at the same moment, occupying seats to the right of the chair.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It was a subject of general remark that the foreign corps never was so fully represented as on this occasion.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   The ministers, attachés, and others numbered in all some fifty and over, and their brilliancy of dress, the number of their decorations, crates, etc., added much to the imposing nature of the scene.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Some of the court uniforms were particularly gorgeous and attracted much attention.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The scene in the Senate, while waiting the arrival of the Presidential Party, seemed to realize the lying down of the lamb and the lion together, or the mingling of oil and water.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Messier's Chase, Wakefall, Kritenden, Wilson, and others hobnobbing with the utmost cordiality.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Senator Breckenridge was conversing familiarly with the extremist men of the Republicans, while ladies of all political affinities, Mrs. Hamlin among them, looked smilingly down upon the animated scene below.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The attendance of Senators was usually full, the only absences noticed, being those of Messier's Mason and Hunter of Virginia.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   At fifteen minutes to one o'clock, the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States of America were announced by the doorkeeper of the Senate.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   On their entrance, all on the floor arose, and the venerable judges, headed by the Chief Justice Taney, moved slowly to the seats assigned them immediately to the right of the Vice President, each exchanging salutes with that officer in passing the chair.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   At ten minutes after one o'clock, an unusual stir occurred in the chamber, and the rumor spread like wildfire that the President-elect was in the building.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   At fifteen minutes past one o'clock, the Marshal and Chief Major B.B. French entered the chamber, ushering in the President and the President-elect.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   They had entered together from the street through a private covered passageway on the north side of the Capitol, police officers being in attendance to prevent outsiders from crowding after them.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   The line of procession was then formed in the following manner.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Marshal of the District of Columbia, judges of Supreme Court and Sergeant at Arms, Senate Committee of Arrangements, President of the United States and President-elect, Vice President, Secretary of the Senate, Senators, Diplomatic Corps, Heads of the Departments, Governors and others in the chamber.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   When the word was given for members of the House to fall into the line of procession, a violent rush was made for the door, accompanied by loud outcries, violent pushing and great disturbance.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   After the procession had reached the platform, Senator Baker of Oregon introduced Mr. Lincoln to the Assembly.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   On Mr. Lincoln advancing to the stand, he was cheered, but not very loudly.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Unfolding his manuscript in a loud, clear voice, he read his message as follows.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   President Lincoln's inaugural address.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Fellow citizens of the United States.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   In compliance with a custom as old as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the President before he enters upon the duties of his office.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a Republican administration, their property and their permanent peace and security are to be endangered.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I do but quote from one of these speeches when I declare that I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance and as a law to themselves and to me the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Resolved that the maintenance in violet of the rights of the states and especially the right of each according to its own judgment exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And we denounce the lawless invasion by an armed force of any state or territory, no matter under what pretext as the greatest of crimes.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I now reiterate these sentiments, and in doing so, I only press upon the public attention, the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace and security of no section are to be in any wise, endangered by the now incoming administration.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Add to that all the protection which consistently with the Constitution and the laws can be given will be cheerfully given to all states when lawfully demanded for whatever cause as cheerfully to one section as to another.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   There is much controversy about delivering up fugitives from service or labor.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   No person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall inconsequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on a claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the law giver as the law.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   To the proposition then that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up, their oaths are unanimous.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Now if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   There is some difference of opinion, whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority, but surely that difference is not a very material one.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done, and should anyone in any case be content that his oaths should be uncapped on a merely substantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Again, in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced so that a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave, and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   which guarantees that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I take the official oath today with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or the laws by any hypocritical rules, and while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepeeled than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It is 72 years since the first inauguration of a president under our national Constitution.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   During that period, 15 different and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive branch of the government.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   They have conducted it through many perils and generally with great success.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Yet with all this scope of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulties.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menace, is now formidable attempted.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of these states is perpetual.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Continue to execute all the expressed provisions of our national Constitution and the Union will endure forever.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   It being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Again, if the United States be not a government proper but an association of states in the name of a contract merely,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   can it as a contract be peacefully unmade by less than all the parties who made it?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   One party to a contract may violate or break it so to speak, but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   It was formed in fact by the Articles of Association in 1774.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   It was further matured and the faith of all the then-13 states expressly plited and engaged that it should be perpetual
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   by the Articles of Confederation in 1778 and finally in 1787.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   One of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was to form a more perfect Union,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   but if destruction of the Union by one or part only of the states be lawfully possible,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   the Union is less than before the Constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   It follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   that resolves in ordinances to that effect are legally void,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   or revolutionary according to circumstances.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   and to the extent of my ability I shall take care as the Constitution itself expressly enforces upon me
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   that the laws of the United States be faithfully executed in all the states.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part, and I shall perform it so far as practicable,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisition, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   and collect the duties and imposts, but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   no using of force against or among the people anywhere.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Where hostility to the United States in any interior territory shall be so great and so universal
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   as to prevent the competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among people that object.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   While the strict legal right may exist for the government to enforce the exercise of these offices,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable with all that I deem it better to forgo for a time the use of such offices.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   The males, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union so far as possible.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   The people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   The course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and with a view and a hope to a peaceful solution of the national trouble and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do so,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I will neither affirm or deny, but if there should be such, I need address no word to them.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   To those, however, who really love the Union, may I not speak?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Before entering upon so grave a matter is the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Would it not be well to ascertain precisely why we do it?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Will you, while the certain ills you fly to, are greater than all the real ones you fly from?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Will you risk the commission of such a fearful mistake?
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   All protests to be content in the Union, if all constitutional rights can be maintained.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Is it true, then, that any right plainly written in the Constitution has been denied?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I think not.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Happily, the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach the audacity of doing this.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   If, by mere force of numbers, a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   It certainly would, if such right were a vital one.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   But such is not the case.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   All the vital rights of minorities and individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negatives,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   guarantees and prohibitions in the Constitution, that controversies never arise concerning them.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in the practical administration.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length, contain, express provisions for all possible questions.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or state authority?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   The Constitution does not expressly say, must Congress protect slavery in the territories?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   The Constitution does not expressly say.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government will cease.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   There is no other alternative for continuing the government, but acquiescence on the one side or the other.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   If a minority in such a case will secede, rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which, in turn, will divide and ruin them, for a minority of their own will secede from them, whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   For instance, why may not a portion of a new Confederacy, a year or two hence, arbitrarily secede again, precisely as a portion of the present union now claims to secede from it?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily, with the deliberate changes of popular opinion and sentiment, is the only change in our country.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   The rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement is wholly inadmissible, so that rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form, is all that is left.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I do not forget the position assumed by some, that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   While they are also entitled to very high respect and considerations in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may become a precedent for other cases can better be born than could the evils of a different practice.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made an ordinary litigation between parties and personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps as any laws can be, in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after a separation of the sections than before.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and reach of each other, but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face-to-face and intercourse, either amicable or hostile relations, must continue between them.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than law can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always, and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   This country, with its institutions, belongs to those who inhabited.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Whenever they grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending, or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   I cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   While I make no recommendation of amendment, I fully recognize the authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself, and I should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take a proposition originated by others, not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they wish to either accept or refuse.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution, which amendment I have not seen, has passed Congress to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states, including that of persons held to service.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I now depart from my purpose, not to speak of particular amendments, so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states. The people themselves can do this alone if they choose, but the executive as such has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer the present government as it came to his hands, and to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world in our present differences? Is either party without faith of being in the right?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   If the Almighty ruler of nations will, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the north, or on yours of the south, that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   While the people retain virtue and vigilance, no administration of any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously impair the government in the short space of four years.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   My countrymen, one in all, think calmly and well upon the whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   But no good object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaired and on the sensitive point of the laws of your own framing under it, while the new administration have no immediate power if it would to change either.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bands of affection, the mystic call of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulties.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without yourselves being the aggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Protect and defend it.
