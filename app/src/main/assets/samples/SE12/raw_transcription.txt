[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   Hey everybody, my name is Andrew, and I'm Suzanne, and you're listening to Q-Lips.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:23.040]   Hey everyone, welcome back to another edition of the Q-Lips English podcast.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.880]   Today we have a Speak Easy episode for you, which is our Pronunciation series, which is
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.840]   really run by my trusty co-host Suzanne.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.320]   So today I am joined by Suzanne, hey Sue.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.640]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.120]   Not too bad.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.440]   Suzanne, you have an interesting topic here for us today.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:58.480]   It is an introduction to the pronunciation feature that's called intonation, intonation.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.460]   Yes, intonation, exactly.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.560]   So intonation is a really important pronunciation feature that can really affect how clear and
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.720]   comprehensible your English is.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.880]   It's a really vital feature to focus on, and Sue is going to tell us all about it today.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.120]   Give us an introduction to it, but just before we jump into that everyone, I want to remind
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.680]   you that the best way to study with Q-Lips is with our study guide, and you can download
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.160]   that from our website, which is qlips.com, and there's a transcript inside of it, so you
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.000]   can follow along and read every word that you'll hear us use today.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.960]   But there's also a lot of bonus pronunciation exercises that Sue has made to accompany
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   this lesson.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.560]   So it's a really great way to study pronunciation here with us in the study guide.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.640]   And again, that's on our website, qlips.com, so check it out.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:15.640]   Okay, Suzanne, let's start.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   Intonation.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.680]   I was thinking we could kind of maybe start off by defining intonation, right?
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.120]   Figuring out what it really means, because I think it can get confusing as to what intonation
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   really is.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   Absolutely.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.400]   And I think even a lot of English native speakers don't know what intonation is.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.840]   It's not a common word.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.160]   We don't use it in our everyday speaking.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.120]   So it's important that we clarify this concept of intonation.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.240]   And I mean, Sue, you know better than I do, but when I think of intonation, I think of
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:07.360]   music and pitch and the movements of pitch, kind of like going from high tones to low
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.160]   tones and high tones and low tones.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   Exactly.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   Is that correct?
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160]   I mean, it is.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:24.680]   It's really, if you think about it, intonation is really the music of a language, the tones,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.340]   the pitches, how they move from one to the other.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.600]   So we can really define intonation as the rise and fall of pitch in our speech.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   So earlier you had asked me about pitch.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.840]   Well, is intonation just pitch or is it the same?
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:57.600]   So intonation is made up of lots of pitches or different pitches that become one contour
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.280]   or one piece of music or one line of music, one phrase.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.600]   So it's not just one pitch.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.840]   It's the kind of fluctuation or change from one pitch to the next in our speech.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.000]   Okay, so it's not just like one musical note, right?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.400]   It's like a bunch of notes connected, that kind of make a melody, could we explain it
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   that way?
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:40.240]   So like say I gave you a dialogue and I said, okay, tomorrow bring in the intonation contour.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:50.640]   That would be you writing down the pitch changes on your paper, like you were writing music,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   right?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.720]   Like you were writing like music to your lyrics in a way.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.720]   Okay.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.160]   The intonation is kind of the whole sheet of music, whereas a pitch is just like one note
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.760]   on that sheet.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.400]   Okay, I got it.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   I got it.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.440]   And intonation is sometimes ignored because, I mean, I don't know about you, but most
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:26.800]   of the time when we're listening to somebody speak, whether it's in person or on a podcast
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.720]   or maybe on TV, many times we're just listening to the meaning.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.960]   We're focused in on the words, the vocabulary, the grammar.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.980]   So we're not really focusing on the intonation or the stress either.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:53.080]   Those are like the things that are helping our vocabulary and our grammar.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.640]   And those are things that we don't see in the forefront.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.840]   They're not really in them as the main character many times.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.360]   So people don't really think about it.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.200]   It's not their favorite feature maybe, but it's very, very important and very helpful
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:23.320]   as we'll see in our episode today that it can really change and alter the meaning of
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.840]   your utterance, of your speech.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.880]   And really affect the emotional quality of your speech too.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   Exactly.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.080]   We use intonation often when we are expressing emotion, right?
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.360]   It's like happy and excited emotion sounds very different than angry and sad and stressed
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.680]   emotion and intonation.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680]   Totally.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   Even like us, right?
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:57.080]   A podcast intonation is very different than a TV show intonation where you also see the
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   people and you see, right, or like a conversation with a professor.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:11.720]   A professor giving a lecture intonation kind of intonation is different than going to
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.600]   see like a stand up comedian or something.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   Exactly.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.200]   You don't even need to hear the words that they're saying.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   You could probably listen to just the you know, like a, like you're watching the Tarly
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.720]   Brown cartoon and you would actually go, that sounds like a comedy show, right?
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   You could probably figure out what you're listening to just by the intonation.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:50.520]   I think that if our listeners have previous exposure to intonation, maybe they've studied
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.480]   it a little bit when it comes to question formation because I do think that's one area
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   that is taught in like English classes is basic question intonation kind of like the
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.080]   rising intonation at the end of certain questions, right?
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   That's studied.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:17.760]   Go a little bit deeper in it today and guys really what our plan here today is is to introduce
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.720]   you to this concept and to help you notice it in your future English listening.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   It's kind of an introduction to it because I have a gut feeling that a lot of people
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:38.320]   ignore intonation for the most part, but as we said, it can be really impactful and really
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.920]   help you make your English clearer and kind of the first step to using it in your own
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.840]   speech is to know what to listen for.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:52.560]   And so this is what we're going to help you discover today is to know what to listen
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.480]   for in your future English listening.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   Exactly.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:04.080]   So today is really focusing on your perception and learning how to perceive that intonation
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:11.880]   in your speech and in the speech that you hear, for example, on podcasts or in TV shows
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:18.360]   and just start to open your ears and your mind to listening to the music of English.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:27.560]   In a future episode, we'll look at sort of more application and ways you can apply intonation
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:34.340]   to your speech for effective comprehensibility.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:42.200]   So I think one thing I want everyone to know is that and maybe this is going to make people
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:49.720]   sad, but don't bum us out, Suzanne, I've been having such a good day today.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   Oh, I know.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   Sorry.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.360]   I'm going to kind of bum you guys out, but for the most part, I mean, maybe not a
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:04.960]   hundred percent, but probably like 90 percent of English intonation is really narrow.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   Narrow.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   Narrow.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.160]   So when we say narrow, we mean like, well, if you look at a piece of music, right, you
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:19.160]   see like a note that goes from like, down here to up here, right?
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.280]   It's like a really big jump that would not be narrow.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.960]   That's a very wide range.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.960]   Exactly.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.280]   It has a wide range.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.160]   But English doesn't.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.680]   English has a very short range.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.780]   We don't usually go all the way up and then all the way down and then all the way up and
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.920]   then all the way down and all the way.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.280]   It's rarely going to have such high, wide fluctuations.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.800]   So I hate to break it to everybody, but we're kind of a little more boring in English.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.360]   I would say.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:01.200]   Right, and Sue, we were talking a little bit off air about French speakers in Quebec,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:08.000]   where you live in Montreal and how it's the opposite with French and French is really,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.880]   it does have that very wide range of intonation patterns available.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:18.680]   And it's much more musical for sure, whereas I agree with you that English is in a more
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:24.440]   narrow range, and I think it's almost monotone.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.240]   To me, of course, there is intonation, but it's not to the same extent as we have in
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   other languages.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.360]   And of course, different Asian languages have lots of different pitch and intonation functions
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.040]   that are really meaningful, too, that can change the different meaning of the sentence.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.360]   We don't have that in English, of course, very much, maybe a tiny bit.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   A little bit.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.560]   Well, you know, we're also, remember speaking about North American English, right?
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.840]   Because if we look at like Irish, Scottish, Australian, for example, English, that's native
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.520]   speaker English, but it's also a lot different.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:12.320]   There are certain sounds that are just different that we don't do in North America.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.160]   And the music is very different, right?
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.240]   So like if I were to do an Irish accent, and I'm sure that it's not perfect right now,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.800]   but they're going all but the end, you know, and like that's very different.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.920]   We don't talk like that in the United States or in Canada, right?
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.000]   We don't really do that.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.480]   So that is an intonation contour that is common to Ireland or parts of Ireland, but
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.000]   not common to North America.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.520]   Now the second thing I'm going to say that kind of explains this concept of narrow is
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:59.720]   if you think about our sort of categories of languages, Andrew, you talked about certain
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.640]   Asian languages, which are more tonal, right?
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:11.640]   So they are ruled by the tone, the tone in which you speak or the pitch will actually
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.440]   tell you the meaning, right?
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.680]   It carries the meaning of the right of the sentence or the word.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:26.480]   And so this is tonal and that you can kind of look at if we drew that out, it would have
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.080]   like lots of ups and downs.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:35.600]   If we looked at it like a waveform on an audio recording system, we'd see that it would
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.200]   go like up and down and up and down, up and down, and it would have a lot of variation
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.680]   because that's where the meaning is.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:52.720]   If you look at another languages like French or Italian, for example, they would be like
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:00.280]   the second lowest, like if tonal languages have high peaks and ranges, maybe French and
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.480]   Italian kind of languages would have medium peaks and valleys.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:13.240]   They would have like a medium wide range and this is because they are a syllable timed
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.700]   language.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:23.200]   And when you are a syllable timed language, you actually really pronounce the entire syllable.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.760]   You really pay attention to saying all the sounds in the syllable and that causes your
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:37.040]   intonation to sort of reach a little bit more. There's a little bit more of a bounce.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:45.560]   Now English, however, is a stress timed language so we can think of it instead of going up
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:54.000]   and down that it kind of goes wide side to side like, Hey, Andrew, how's it going?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.360]   Like I don't even need to move my my pitch. All I have to do is elongate, make it louder,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.760]   stretch, right?
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:11.480]   That movie was crazy, dude, right? I don't need to go up or down. I can move side to side.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:18.140]   And so that's kind of if we look at it like a visual, that's sort of how we can do a quick
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:24.160]   and easy image in our mind of why English is like that. More narrow.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.600]   Okay. Yeah, that's really interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it helps to think of the
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:37.440]   visual aspect of it to kind of imagine like a waveform, an audio waveform that you'd see
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.800]   on a computer. And when you think of it that way, it's it's pretty easy to visualize and
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:50.960]   understand. Yeah. And I would say like the only time that we really use high pitches
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:16:01.200]   are when we are truly using emphatic stress or like emotion, right? Like no way. What?
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.520]   Yeah. That's crazy, right? We don't think that's when I use like high pitch like that
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.760]   is like when I'm talking with my friends and I should say that kind of high intonation
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.840]   is when I'm talking with my friends and something really surprising happens. Like, yeah, maybe
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.040]   Suzanne, you had some good news to share with me. So you're like, Andrew, guess what?
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:32.600]   I won the lottery. And I'd be like, what? No way. Exactly. And you really jump right
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:40.160]   like you jump like three or four notes or something like to your falsetto like, what?
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.600]   No way. But then you go right back, right? No way. That's so cool. That's crazy. Right?
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.360]   Yeah. We don't stay there. We don't go back there very often. So it's right. Again, North
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:58.440]   American intonation. We can't speak for the entire native speaking English world. But
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:05.000]   let me ask you, Andrew, like, do you notice that about you when you're, you know, listening
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.840]   to yourself on Qlips or editing some of the podcast episodes? What do you notice about
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:18.680]   your intonation? Of course, I think everybody hates to an extent their own voice, right?
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.080]   Right. Right. It's true. I think a lot of people say like, Oh, my voice, why does it
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:30.240]   have to sound like that? I've got pretty used to the sound of my voice because I spend,
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.480]   you know, hours every week preparing Qlips episodes and editing them and relistening
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:43.560]   to them. So I'm forced to pay a lot more attention to my voice than I usually have to. And to
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.240]   be honest with you, I think it sounds really monotone a lot of the time. When I listen back
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.600]   to myself, I'm always like, Oh, why am I not being more emphatic? Why am I not using
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:03.000]   more intonation? Because it sounds, you know, kind of flat and monotone. Yeah, but that's
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.800]   natural. Yeah, that's natural. I think one of the things that I realized is that a lot
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:16.080]   of the times when I compare myself to other podcasters, the other podcasters are really
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.200]   trying to be broadcasters and trying to be entertainers, you know, so they're speaking
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:27.360]   in a way that's not natural. They're like, Hey, everybody, welcome to the cool guys podcast.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:34.160]   You know, but like, we're, we're trying to speak naturally for our listeners so that
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.000]   they get a real sense of natural English. And I think that's, that's why my voice tends
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.320]   to sound a little monotone, a little flat, even though I wish it wasn't always that way.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:55.040]   Yeah, I totally agree. The key is sort of what's your learning and speaking goal. If you're
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:02.440]   trying to emulate or give an example of natural speech, then that's kind of this. That's not
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:10.280]   really, you know, Hey, guys, how's it going? But maybe I would do that in a different context,
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:18.120]   right? On the intro or the outro, or maybe you would do like a different intonation,
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:26.120]   you know, if you're telling a crazy story. But for the most part, we tend to hang out
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:33.560]   in this kind of one to three note at the most range. So the third thing I want to cover
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:40.600]   about this is that it, and something that you said in the beginning about how it can really
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:47.880]   affect the emotion that you're conveying, the intonation, it doesn't matter what you say
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:58.920]   sometimes, but how you say it. So if you're changing your intonation to not many peaks and
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:06.040]   valleys, you will convey a certain emotion. And then maybe if you change the exact same text,
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:15.160]   so that it has more peaks and valleys, lots of pitch changes, higher ranges, you might actually
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:23.000]   convey a very different emotion with the exact same message. So this is something actors look
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.080]   at all the time. And we have a little example here. So let's listen to the example in the first
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:40.920]   way and see if our listeners can guess what the emotion behind it is, what we're kind of conveying,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:50.840]   or how we sound in the first version. Okay. Right. So we're going to read this guys two times,
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:58.120]   all right, it's the same example, the same sample dialogue, but we're going to read it using two
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:05.560]   different intonation patterns. And we hope that you can notice and hear the different intonation
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:13.400]   when you compare the two of them. So here we go, Suzanne, let's read this example conversation
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.120]   for the first time. And then we'll do it again a second time. Awesome.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:28.680]   Hey, did you hear about Carol? Yeah, she got a new job. Yeah, I can't believe she's moving to Ottawa.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:37.080]   Crazy. I think she said she was leaving next week. Maybe we can go visit her. Yeah, maybe.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:46.120]   Okay, guys, we're going to do this one more time. Same conversation, same vocabulary, but
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:55.080]   different intonation now. Okay. Hey, did you hear about Carol? Yeah, she got a new job.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:02.040]   Yeah, I can't believe she's moving to Ottawa. Crazy. I think she said she was leaving next week.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.720]   Yeah, maybe we can go visit her. Yeah, maybe.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:16.120]   All right. So I think the difference between those two is really shocking. Actually, I'm a little
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:22.760]   surprised to hear them myself how different they sound. Yeah, for sure. It's like we're in a whole
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:28.520]   different TV show, right? If that was a scene, like the first one is maybe like a really serious
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:36.040]   show. And the second one is like a comedy, right? Like some sitcom or whatever. Yeah, if anybody
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:43.640]   didn't pick up on it, the first conversation we read with a disappointed intonation pattern,
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.520]   kind of depressed or gloomy intonation pattern. And then we were very happy and excited for the
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:56.040]   second one. And yeah, I was interpreting it like in the first example, maybe the coworkers were
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:05.560]   really sad that Carol was leaving and got a new job and was moving to Ottawa, the capital city of
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:11.320]   Canada. But then in the second example, I thought, oh, they're really excited and proud of their
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.920]   coworker and supportive and happy that she got a new job. Yeah, and excited to go visit, you know,
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:26.360]   like, right, let's go. Now we can go see her there. Right, right, right. Yeah, so exactly. I mean,
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:35.000]   this is a very stark example, right? It's a very obvious example of how intonation can change your
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.880]   emotion and your message and the meaning behind your message. And if you noticed in the first version,
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:53.080]   we really did not use many intonational shifts. We maybe went, if we were kind of talking about
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:59.800]   notes, we maybe went up a half note, you know, just like a little bit. Hey, did you hear about Carol?
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:11.480]   Carol, Carol, Carol, right? Yeah, she got a new job job job job, right? It's it's very subtle that
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:19.960]   we're lifting a little bit. Whereas in the second version, we really shifted quite a bit in just
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:30.120]   one thought, right? Hey, even in just that word. Hey, did you hear about Carol? Right? So we're
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:38.920]   accessing higher pitches and we're shifting them more often to show excitement. I mean, if you even
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:45.320]   looked at this, like in all, if we drew a line like a contour, which we're going to do next,
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:52.760]   next episode. Yes. If you looked at a contour, you'd see that it'd be very spiky, right? Like,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:25:01.240]   really excited. It would look excited that line. Right, yeah. And the disappointed version would
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:06.680]   also look kind of disappointed. It would kind of just hang down and not really move that much,
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:14.840]   right? Just kind of stale and flat. Yeah, exactly. Totally. So all this to say that
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:25.640]   as you listen to Culep's podcasts, as you listen to other podcasts and maybe watch TV shows,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:32.520]   see if you can close your eyes for a second and just listen to the music. Maybe listen to some
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:41.160]   stand-up comedians, maybe switch it up and listen to some comedies, some dramas, and see if you can
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:51.080]   notice a difference within the intonational contour or the pitch change. Is it changing a lot,
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:58.120]   like a happy song, like the music is going up and down and up and down? Or is it kind of staying
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:07.480]   here most of the time? I don't know. You'll kind of perceive that. And we'd love to hear from you
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:17.560]   guys about it, what you have found, your research, watching and listening, and let us know what you
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:27.800]   noticed in the intonation in different media. Yeah, absolutely. And if I could just offer up one
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:34.920]   quick tip here as well before we finish up, I would say, guys, if you want to practice intonation,
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:43.880]   shadowing could be a really cool way to do that. But I would suggest using something that is really,
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:51.400]   really easy for you. Okay, so don't jump into, you know, taking a scene from a movie that's really
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.520]   hard for you to understand and maybe has some vocabulary that you're not really familiar with.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:05.560]   Take some audio. Maybe it's like a Qub simplified speech episode or something. A part of that is
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:14.040]   very easy for you to understand and shadow with that. Because as Suzanne said, sometimes if you're
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:21.400]   not familiar with the vocabulary or the grammar in what you're listening to, it can be hard to hear
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:27.560]   some of the intonation and other pronunciation features. So I would recommend practicing
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:35.640]   these pronunciation techniques, like intonation with something that's very easy for you to understand.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:52.120]   Well, everyone that brings us to the end of today's episodes. Thanks, as always, Suzanne,
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:59.080]   that was very insightful. Yeah, of course, it's my pleasure. And everyone, once again, our website
