[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.580]   The British Medical Journal, referring to the White Chappell Murders, says, "The coroner's
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.920]   theory that the assassin's work was carried out under the impulse of a pseudoscientific
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.080]   mania has been exploded by the first attempt at serious investigation. It is true that
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.480]   a foreign physician inquired a year ago as to the possibility of securing certain parts
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.600]   of the body for the purpose of scientific investigation. But no large sum was offered,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.840]   and the physician in question is of the highest respectability and came exceedingly well accredited."
