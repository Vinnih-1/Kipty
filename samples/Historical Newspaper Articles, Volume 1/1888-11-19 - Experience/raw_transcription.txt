[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   His arrest in London, not his first experience, from the New York Times, November 19, 1888,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   recorded for LibraVox.org by Leanne Hallet.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   The same Tumblety, his arrest in London, not his first experience.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   The Doctor Tumblety, who was arrested in London a few days ago on suspicion of complicity in the white chapel murders,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   and who improved innocent of that charge, was held for trial in the Central Criminal Court
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   for special law covering the offenses disclosed in the late modern Babylon scandal,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   will be remembered by any number of Brooklynites and New Yorkers as Dr. Blackburn, the Indian herb doctor.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   He is the fellow who in 1861, burst upon the people of Brooklyn as a sort of modern count of Monte Cristo.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   He was of striking personal appearance, being considerably over six feet in height,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   of graceful and powerful build, with strong, marked features, beautifully clear complexion,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   sweeping moustache and jet black hair.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   He went dashing about the streets mounted on a handsome light chestnut horse,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and dressed in the costliest and most elaborate riding costumes,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and soon had a stream of customers at his office and laboratory on Fulton Street near the City Hall.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   In these rides, he was invariably accompanied by a valet as handsomely apparel and horses himself,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and a brace of superb English Greyhounds.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   He boarded with a Mrs. Foster at 95 Fulton Street, then a fashionable quarter of the city,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   and cut a wide swath in the affections of the feminine lodgers.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   After a few months, he dropped out of sight as suddenly and as mysteriously as he had appeared,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   and was next heard of as being implicated in the famous yellow fever importation
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   and black bag plots that the rebel sympathizers tried to develop in New York during the Civil War.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It was at this time that his relation to the celebrated Blackburn family of Kentucky became known,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   and he thereafter went by his real name instead of his curious, assumed name, Tumblety.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   His interest in the two previously mentioned plots was, luckily for him, so slight that he was allowed to go unpunished,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   while several of his associates did not get off so easily.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   For several years after this, he kept pretty well out of the public gaze,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and then suddenly took up his herb-doctoring business with its attendant swagger again.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He visited both this city and Brooklyn at about semi-yearly intervals,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and became a member of several questionable clubs.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   He dropped out of sight some ten years ago, and the first that has been heard of him since
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   is the news of his arrest and imprisonment in London.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   End of article. This recording is in the public domain.
