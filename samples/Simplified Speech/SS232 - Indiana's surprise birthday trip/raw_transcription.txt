[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.560]   and joining me today for this episode is Indiana. Hey there, Indiana, how's it going?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.280]   Hey, Andrew, I'm doing awesome as I've just turned 30 and I'm coming off of a great trip
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.320]   with my husband last week, so I'm in a pretty good mood.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.160]   Awesome, well, happy belated birthday from me and all of our Q-lips listeners on behalf of all
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.880]   of our listeners as well. I'm sure they would love to wish you a happy birthday and happy belated
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.080]   birthday is what we can say when your birthday has already passed, right? Like, Indiana, your
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.160]   birthday was what, a week ago, several days ago? It was pretty recent, right? But when it's already
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.760]   passed, but you still feel like you want to congratulate someone on a birthday, then you can say happy
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.960]   belated birthday. So yeah, Indiana, happy belated birthday. And today in this episode, you are really
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.800]   going to be the star Indiana. We're going to talk all about your birthday, how you celebrated it,
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.600]   and a special surprise trip that you took. But everyone, before we get started, let me tell you

[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.160]   Okay, and with that announcement out of the way, Indiana, I think we should jump right in and get
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.800]   started with your story. So let's start at the start. Where do you want to begin? Do you want to
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.000]   begin with the birthday or the trip? What what's the best way to approach this? Sure, so I'll start
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   with a small story about the fact that last year for my husband's 30th birthday, I planned a small
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.920]   surprise trip for him where he didn't know where we were going to go. But he knew that we would be
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.280]   away for the weekend and I organized it so that all our friends went with us to visit a town in
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.680]   Massachusetts where we did a bunch of fun things like go to a barcade, which is like an arcade where
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.200]   you play games and drink alcohol and play pinball and stuff like that. We call that a barcade?
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.320]   A barcade? Yes, exactly. Okay, so it's like a blend of bar and arcade. I love that. That sounds
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.960]   really fun. It's so much fun. So like I planned various activities for for him that he would be
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.040]   into and that we both would be into in our friends last year for his 30th birthday. We went to Mass
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.640]   Mocha, which is a really cool modern art museum in Massachusetts. So I did this nice fun trip
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   for his 30th. That was last year and then this year I turned 30. So I think I was kind of like,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:20.400]   oh, I hope we do something fun. I hope we have a good time for my big milestone 30th birthday.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.720]   So I think he got the obvious hint that I wanted to do something fun and maybe go on a trip or have
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.400]   some sort of celebration. So he really planned a really cool, much bigger trip actually, which
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.280]   was a surprise for me. And he said, we're going, we're flying somewhere. So we went to the airport
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.760]   the day before my birthday and I had no idea where we were going to go until we got to the check-in
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.320]   and they said, enjoy your flight to Las Vegas. And I was like, huh? Okay, so for his birthday,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.160]   you went all out, you planned this big trip, a lot of fun events, going to a barcade, going to an art
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   gallery, going to Massachusetts. So yeah, a really cool trip last year for his birthday. And then you
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.360]   were kind of expecting the same treatment in return for your birthday here. And as you said,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.840]   your 30th birthday is a milestone. It's a milestone birthday. Maybe we should explain what that means
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   to our listeners. What does it mean if you have a milestone birthday? Yes. So a milestone is any
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:40.640]   sort of significant date either because it's an even decade, like 30, 40 or 50, or because something
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.680]   good happens that year that's kind of exciting or a step of maturity for you. Like when you turn 21
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.000]   in the States, that's a milestone because now you can legally drink alcohol, or I suppose get 18
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.720]   as well, because I think you can you can vote. There's lots of things you get to do at that age.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.760]   But after you get past those few, I think maybe some people might consider 25, 35 also milestones,
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.160]   but the biggest milestones are those decades, like 60, 70, anything like an even decade.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.360]   16th is also big. Get your driver's license, at least in Canada. It's 16 years old. I know it's
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.360]   a little bit different from region to region. We call it the sweet 16 birthday party, right?
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.880]   Did you have a sweet 16 when you turned 16? I did. I don't think it was particularly lavish or
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.720]   exciting, but I did definitely have a party. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So this must have been quite
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.440]   the surprise. You're ready to travel, but you don't know where you're going at all.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.000]   And then you get to the airport and you find out Las Vegas. Okay, we're going to Las Vegas,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.040]   Nevada, western part of the United States. And I'm wondering, did your husband tell you like
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.560]   what to pack or anything? Like did you have any idea at all? Because Las Vegas is in the desert,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.240]   right? If you're bringing like a winter parka or something, it's not very practical. So did you
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.800]   have like any inkling, any idea at all about where you'd be going based on what he told you to prepare?
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.400]   So I did ask him for tips on packing. And I was like, okay, what are the temperatures going to be?
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.200]   What kind of stuff do I need? So he tried to keep it as vague as possible, but he gave me the day
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.960]   time and nighttime temperatures. So I was like, okay, I know we must be going somewhere warm. So maybe
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.800]   we're going south to Florida or something, the southern United States, or maybe California,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.160]   something like that. I was thinking like, wow, that's a big trip. But yeah, I had some sense of the
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:52.800]   climate, I suppose. And let's talk about Las Vegas for a little bit here, because it is really a
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.160]   unique place. I think maybe there's nowhere in the world quite like Las Vegas. Unfortunately,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.520]   I've never been there. I would like to visit at some point. It's only a couple hours away from my
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:12.080]   hometown by airplane. And there are lots of cheap flights and packages to go from Canada to Las Vegas.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.240]   So it's pretty easy to travel there. And so that's why so many people I know have been there. So I've
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.080]   heard lots of stories, but I haven't been there myself. But could you just maybe paint a picture
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:31.520]   for us about what kind of city Las Vegas is? So I think Las Vegas is most famous as being a
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.120]   place where you can go to the casino. There are so many different casinos all owned by the same
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   company, I believe. There's the Las Vegas Strip, which is this main street that is just covered
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:55.120]   with restaurants and venues for concerts or magic shows and tons of casinos. So like, I think the
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:02.480]   impression that I had before I visited, and of course that impression was upheld. It was true.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.360]   When I went there, it was like it was going to be a non-stop kind of city where there's always
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.080]   something going on. And it's very bright and flashy and in your face. Like, come to this store, come
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:23.440]   to this casino, like very, very intense. Yes. Okay, so it's got a reputation for casinos,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:35.600]   for gambling, for unique hotels, for shows and performances. Like you said, magic shows, comedy
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.480]   shows, concerts. And I think when it comes to concerts, and we'll get into this a little bit more,
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:50.160]   I think of residencies. So maybe an artist that instead of touring from city to city to city,
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:57.040]   we'll do a residency in Vegas, where they will perform several times a week for a long time for
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:04.720]   like six months. I know the famous Canadian singer Celine Dion, she did a Vegas residency for years.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.880]   So instead of touring the world, she stayed in one place, and you could go to her if you wanted
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.200]   to see one of her concerts. And I think a lot of artists do this. And also, I think of entertainment
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:23.440]   in Vegas as being a little bit older, like it's maybe not where you would see the cutting edge,
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:30.480]   new musicians play, but you could maybe catch an older act. And a lot of singers from
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:37.120]   yester years will perform there. So that's the kind of place that I think of when I think of Vegas.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.920]   I also think of buffet restaurants. I've heard there's a lot of famous buffet restaurants,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.520]   and maybe we can get into that in a second as well. And there are a couple of expressions
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:54.560]   related to Las Vegas that we have some sort of idioms and nicknames. Why don't you tell me if
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:04.640]   these are accurate or not? Okay. The first one that comes to mind is Sin City S I N C I T Y Sin
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.920]   City Las Vegas. And of course, a sin is like doing something immoral, right? Doing something
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.200]   evil or bad. And so Sin City, why do you think people call Las Vegas Sin City? And would you agree
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.720]   that it is a place where sins happen? Well, I would definitely agree. Not only the gambling
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:34.720]   and the casinos, but like, I think everybody's partying, trying to get drunk and like, you know,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:42.480]   there's all sorts of like people on streets and scantily clad outfits sort of come to my
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:50.240]   gentlemen's club come to my business. Yeah. No, for sure. I think it's the very accurate description
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:58.640]   of the city, Sin City, Sin City. And the other kind of idiom that people say when talking about
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:06.240]   Las Vegas is what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas? I'm sure
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.840]   you've heard that one before. What does that mean? Well, you're probably going to go to a city like
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:19.040]   Vegas to to party, as I've said, to to risk it all at the casinos, kind of you're going all out,
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:26.000]   you're doing things you might not normally do on this crazy trip. And so if something you might not
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.240]   want to get back home to your loved ones happens, you know, if the friends you go with or the people
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   that you're with, they should zip their lips at the airport and keep the stories within the city
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.040]   of Vegas. Yeah. So you might do some things that you're not so proud of, or you think, okay,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:50.480]   that those stories are best left unsaid. Yeah, if you lose all your money at the casino,
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.720]   you don't have to share that information with everybody back home. Yeah. I don't know if that
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:03.600]   is an official tourist slogan of Las Vegas or if somebody just created it, but it really spread
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.720]   and is really famous. And I think an attractive thing to a lot of people, they're like, I can go
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.840]   wild in Vegas and kind of keep it a secret and then go back to my regular life after and
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:21.120]   be a different person in Vegas than I am back home. That's right. So listeners might be wondering,
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:29.440]   like, what is Indiana doing in the city? The city. Right. And honestly, so like when I was at the
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:35.920]   airport and then I learned we were going to Las Vegas, it totally threw me for a loop, which means
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:42.800]   I was shocked and confused, like, what? Why are we going here? It's I'm not interested in gambling.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.960]   I mean, I liked a little bit of alcohol. I liked to party like slightly, but like the reputation
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:55.360]   that the city has, it's too much for me. So I was like, okay, surely then maybe we're doing
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.000]   something like an event that's going to be there, you know, and that's why we would go all the way
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.760]   to the city. So I was like, okay, I'm suspicious, but I'm going to trust my husband and assume that
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.880]   he has something wonderful planned. And that's the reason that we're going to this crazy place.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:17.520]   Not because he thinks I'm interested in gambling. Yeah. Yeah, that's a very good point. And we should
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:25.360]   say that many people visit Las Vegas just to explore and just to have fun. And it can be whatever
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.240]   you want it to be. Right. And so yeah, don't assume that just because Indiana visited there,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.040]   that she got up to no good. I'm sure there are tons of people who visit there every year.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:43.040]   Who don't do some kind of immoral things. And with that being said, you get onto the airplane
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.520]   and you're off to Las Vegas. Now, did your husband tell you all of the details about what he had planned
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:57.840]   for the trip at that point? Or was it sort of a surprise that was slowly unveiled and revealed to
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:06.160]   you? It was slowly unveiled, which I think is more fun. Like, you don't know what's in store,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.040]   you don't know what you're going to do. And then at the exact moment where you have a choice,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.000]   like, do you want to go do this thing? Or do you want to go do that thing? That's what we
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.560]   have planned for today. I'm like, Oh, let's do this. You know, like, it's very fun for it to be a last
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:25.440]   minute surprise. I think we both agree about that. So I was like, don't tell me anything until it's
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:32.800]   the moment to do it until I'm there, you know? So yeah, it's slowly, slowly unraveled into.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:40.000]   Oh, that's what we're doing today. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Okay, that's fun. So did you stay at any of
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.960]   the interesting theme hotels? I know there are lots of different like famous hotels. There are
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:54.160]   several different ones with different theme rooms and like really big famous hotel buffets and
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:00.320]   casinos in the hotels. Did you stay at one of those places on the strip? We did. We stayed at the
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:07.360]   Luxor, which is a in the shape of a pyramid and has a massive light shooting out from the top of
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:14.240]   the pyramid into the sky. So you can't miss it from the plane or from the the ground. It was really
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:23.040]   wild. Yeah. And just over the top, so extravagant, ridiculous building, ridiculous experience. But
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:28.240]   yeah, it was kind of neat to just be in that building for sure. I recommend any listeners
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.320]   who are interested to look up some pictures of the Las Vegas strip and like the different hotels
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.760]   that are there, including the Luxor and the shape of a pyramid. What do you mean it's over
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:48.160]   the top and ridiculous? Like, is it the decor? Is it just the general vibe inside? Is it the size?
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:56.800]   How is it over the top? Yeah, just, I mean, because next to this pyramid is a giant sphinx
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:03.680]   statue out front. And there are these walls that are decorated with like, I guess I don't know if
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.600]   they're real hieroglyphics, probably not. But what looks like hieroglyphics and next to this
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:17.040]   building is another hotel, which is in the shape of or supposed to be a medieval cartoonish medieval
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:25.360]   castle from Europe. And then down the street is just some other massive building with a strange
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:32.000]   theme. And it's all just in one mishmash, like, you know, you just look in any direction on something
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.520]   really eye catching and unusual is there. So it's very overwhelming and just kind of like
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.520]   over the top is the word I already used. But it's like, it seems like too much. It's just very
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:51.600]   in your face and attention grabbing. Okay, interesting. Okay, so how about some of the
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.760]   activities you did then? What did your husband plan for you during this trip?
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:04.480]   So as I mentioned, he knew that I would not be into spending like the whole time in the city
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.400]   and doing things on the strip and like shopping. I'm not really into brands or anything. So of
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.920]   course, the first night we had a nice walk around just to see what the environment was like. We got
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:24.240]   some drinks, we got some food. But the next day we went to a desert, I guess you could call it a
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:30.720]   botanical garden, but it featured a lot of desert plants because of course, Nevada is the desert,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.480]   Las Vegas is in the desert. So there was lots of cactuses and really cool desert plants a little
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:42.400]   bit outside of the city. So it was a bit more of a calm, natural experience compared to all of the
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:49.520]   hustle and bustle. And we did that, but then that day was actually my real birthday. And that's when
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:55.680]   this surprise event, as I suspected, we were doing some sort of event that evening. That's when that
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.840]   was going to be. So we did stuff all day. And then we finally, it was time to go to this event,
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.120]   which I still didn't know what it was. So we crossed town on the on the monorail. And we're
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:12.640]   walking into another hotel, another casino. Okay, what's what's the event happening here? I can't seem
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:19.680]   to find any posters or billboards for something that I would recognize like, Oh, this must be what
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:25.280]   we're going to, this must be what we're going to see tonight, until like we're right outside of
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.000]   the entrance of this theater. And I finally see a poster that says tears for fears, which is a band
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.600]   that was really popular in the eighties that me and my husband both love to death. Like we love
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:44.160]   them so much. So I was like, I think I was like, Oh my god, you know, like this is so incredible,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:51.360]   totally worth coming to the sin city for this event. So yeah, we got to see this band that we
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:58.320]   both really love perform live. It wasn't a residency, as you had mentioned earlier, like so it's not
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.680]   like they were in the city for a couple months performing nonstop. But I think it was like three
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.960]   nights of shows that they came for. And yeah, so we saw this wonderful band.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:16.720]   Cool tears for fears. So they're a synth pop band, I guess would be the genre, right? From
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.520]   the eighties. Yeah, new wave and synth pop would probably be the top genre as you'd associate with
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.880]   them totally. I think of their song, Everybody wants to rule the world, right? That was their
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:37.680]   big hit. So what was the concert like? Did you really enjoy it? It was interesting because it was
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:45.760]   seeded and it was in this theater. And something that actually really bugged both of us was before
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:54.160]   the concert started, the venue kept playing these covers of famous tears for fear songs that other
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:01.200]   artists had had done, like they covered these songs, but they were all really bad covers. And
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:07.120]   it was like, why are you torturing me with these awful covers? I wanted to see the band like,
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.160]   don't play any music right now. And then after the show, they also continued to put those covers
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.840]   on. I was like, I don't need to listen to this. I just saw them. It's a bizarre choice, but
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:25.120]   maybe it makes the band actually sound better during the concert, right? It's like when you compare
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.640]   the bad covers to the real deal, the real deal is just going to sound so much better. So I wonder
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:37.600]   if that was a choice of the band to do that just to make their own performance sound good. It's true.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:45.520]   Oh, sneaky tactic. Yeah, very cool. So, Indiana, it sounds like you got up to a lot of different
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.800]   things. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Did you hit up any of the casinos? I didn't
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:57.200]   ask you yet. Did you go gambling at all? Did you do that? Okay, so I really could have gone without
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:04.400]   it, but I said, all right, I'll try the slot machine for two minutes. And it was as uninteresting as
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:11.520]   I expected for me. However, my husband was like, okay, if I'm here, I'd better try the experience.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:20.400]   So he played Blackjack for about an hour. He turned $100 into $90. So I would say he didn't do too bad.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:27.840]   But I think it was very fun for him. And it was, I guess it was cool to learn the game. I had no idea
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.720]   how to play it. So I watched him do it. And it did seem like a novelty, a fun activity to do.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.600]   But yeah, after an hour, I was like, okay, we got to go. I'm getting bored.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:47.920]   Have you ever done any gambling yourself, Andrew? Do you know how to play Blackjack or anything like
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:55.920]   that? I have been to casinos before. I don't know really how to play too many casino games.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:02.480]   I know how to play poker. And I've played poker with my friends. But I don't think I would trust
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.760]   my poker skills at a casino to play with strangers. I'd probably lose all of my money right away.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:16.880]   I think thankfully I'm not really too interested in gambling because I tend to fall in love with
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:23.440]   things that I try. And I know gambling is super, super addictive. And so I don't even really want
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:30.560]   to try it too much. But when I was a first year student in university, my friends and I used to go
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:37.040]   to the casino in my hometown, it was right downtown. So we'd hang out and we'd go to the casino because
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:43.440]   there was this one really big horse racing game in the middle of the casino. It was made by the
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:50.480]   video game company Sega. So I don't, I think this was like a Japanese horse racing machine. And it
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:56.880]   was crazy because it was this big track. And there were these mechanical horses, maybe the size of
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.080]   like a shoe box, think of like a shoe box size horse. And there were maybe 10 of them on this
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.840]   mechanical track. And you could choose what horse you would like to bet on. And then they would do
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:13.840]   a race simulation, like they would race the horses. And one of them would win. And I thought that
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.640]   was so funny. Like you just watch this fake horse race around this mechanical track. And so we would
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.840]   always just bet like a dollar or something. We had no money. We were just students, but it was really
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:34.400]   fun to do that. So yeah, I would bet on the mechanical horses. And I've played bingo in the past bingo.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:43.040]   And bingo halls are a big thing in Canada. Oh, really? Yeah. And if you win bingo, you can get some money.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.800]   That's not really gambling, but it is a game where you can win some money. So that's a lot of fun.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:57.120]   And what else? Yeah, here in Korea, I've been to also, there's a real horse track. And I've
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.880]   been there before, and I placed a bet or two. But again, nothing serious just to sort of
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:09.920]   experience what it's like to do that. But there are a lot of people who do bet seriously on the
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.360]   horses. And I've also been to this was my favorite one, because I really love cycling.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:22.560]   This is cool. Here in the outskirts of Seoul, there is a velodrome, which is a place where
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:29.120]   bike races happen. And there are bike races. So cyclists will race each other. And you can bet
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:35.040]   on which cyclist you think will win. And that is super, super exciting. I loved every second of
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.560]   that when I went there. I've only been once. And I didn't really want to go again, because I was
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.120]   like, this is awesome. This is so much fun. And I could feel like, I might be the guy that's there
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:53.040]   every day betting on the cyclists. Probably not a good thing if I go there too often,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.880]   because I did think it was so awesome. So yeah, I have just a very limited experience
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:06.800]   with gambling. It's not really for me. And yeah, here in Korea, actually, it's interesting.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:13.760]   There as far as I know, there are some casinos that foreigners are allowed to go to, but for just
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.520]   a regular Korean citizen, casinos don't exist as a thing. They're not, they're not available for
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:25.600]   Korean people. They're illegal. So yeah, not too many of them around here, very different than
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.720]   your country and my country, I think. Yeah, that's fascinating. I have been to one casino
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:39.520]   here in Korea that was at a ski resort, actually. And I went with my friends. We were at the ski
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:46.480]   resort and we walked inside. And it was mostly other Asian tourists from different Asian countries.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.760]   I think we were the only Westerners in there. But the vibe was very different at this casino.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:59.440]   It felt heavy. It was very quiet inside a casino in the States or in Canada is going to be really
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:07.920]   lively, lots of lights, lots of music and sounds and just activity hustle and bustle. But this casino
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:14.960]   was very quiet. And I felt like the atmosphere inside the casino change, like people were seriously
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:21.760]   gambling probably for large amounts of money. And we played roulette. We're like, okay, we're
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.440]   going to play one game of roulette. And roulette is the game where you just put the ball into this
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.600]   spinning wheel. And there are different colored slots. And you have to guess will it go into the
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:40.240]   red slot or the black slot, if I'm recalling correctly. And yeah, you can win money that
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:47.120]   way if you can predict where the ball will finish. And we predicted correctly. I think we doubled
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:54.400]   our money. We made a bet of around $5 and we doubled it to $10. And we were really excited. We're
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.440]   like, well, yeah. And everybody looked at us like, shut up. We're seriously gambling in here.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:07.280]   So we quickly just escaped. We left. And that was my only experience in a Korean casino,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.320]   which is over a decade ago. When I first came, it was my very first year in Korea. So yeah,
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.840]   that was the only experience I had. A good one, though, I doubled my money. So I have a good memory
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:27.680]   of visiting there. Cool. Well, Indiana, a very nice conversation. I'm glad that you had a good
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.200]   trip. Do you think Las Vegas is a place that you'll go back to again in the future? Or is it one of
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:40.720]   those one and done destinations? For me, I'm thinking it's probably one and done. It's not
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:47.600]   exactly my kind of, it's not my cup of tea, I could say. And there's plenty of other really cool
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.560]   places. Like I'm very close to New York City. If I want to see a famous musician, I can probably
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:59.440]   go there instead. It's a little shorter of a trip. But it was very special to see this band that I
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:05.920]   love on my actual birthday, the day of my birth. As I turned 30, that was an unforgettable experience.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.320]   So I'm glad I went. But yeah, perhaps I will not be going back anytime soon.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:17.520]   All right. Well, thanks again for telling us all about your trip and listeners. Congratulations
