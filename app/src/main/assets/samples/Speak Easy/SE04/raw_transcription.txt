[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:37.180]   Hey everybody. My name is Andrew. And I'm Suzanne. And you're listening to QLIP's.
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:48.220]   Hi Suzanne. Hi Andrew. How are you? I'm doing very well. And you? How are you? I'm
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.180]   doing very, very well. That is awesome. Glad to hear it. Suzanne, today we have a
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.960]   lot of material to cover. So I think we should get right to it. So today's episode
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.060]   is a "Speak Easy" episode. "Speak Easy" is the series where our resident
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.340]   pronunciation expert Suzanne teaches us some cool pronunciation tips that make
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.220]   our speech sound more like a native speakers. We learn how to talk the way
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.660]   native speakers do. Pronounce the way native speakers do. So Suzanne, what
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:40.420]   topic do you have for us today? So today we're going to look at when to use the
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:52.580]   "S" sound or "S" the "Z" sound or "Z" or the "Is" sound. Whenever we have a plural word
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.660]   or a third person singular verb. Okay. So we are looking at the final sound on a
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.420]   plural or third person singular words. And this can appear in three different
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.700]   ways, right? A "Z" or "Is" form. Exactly. It's always gonna be an "S" in written
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.460]   English. But in spoken English it will be either a "S" or "Is". All right. Awesome.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.220]   Well I'm very excited to dig in to this topic but just before we do that everyone
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.740]   we'd like to remind you that the study guide for this episode is available for
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:46.300]   download on our website which is qlips.com. C-U-L-I-P-S.com. And I think the best way
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.780]   to study with this episode is with the study guide. You'll really get the most
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.540]   out of the content that Sue will share with us here with the study guide. So why
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.780]   don't you visit qlips.com, pick it up and then turn us back on. I think that's a
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.820]   good way to do it to follow along with us in the study guide. So anyway Sue let's
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:20.180]   get started and we're looking at "S" and "Z" plurals. So yeah what is it? What is
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.220]   an "S" and what is a "Z" plural? Yeah so when words are plural like when you're
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:40.940]   describing one or more of something like books or vacations or boxes you will add
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.740]   an "S" at the end of the written word to make it plural but when you speak the
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:58.740]   plural word you can have three different sounds. So when you make book plural you
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:08.900]   add an "S" and it sounds like "S" books. When you make vacation plural it looks like
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:19.300]   an "S" in the written word but it sounds like a "Z" or a "Z" vacations and when you make box
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:30.940]   plural you'll see there is an "ES" added but it will sound like an "Is" boxes. You know I speak
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.020]   with a lot of non-native English speakers every day. I'm working with
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.380]   people who use English as their second language and to be perfectly honest
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.420]   pluralizing words is something that is difficult for everybody learning English.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.660]   I hear many many mistakes so I think for a lot of you listeners out there this
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.740]   will be really a helpful episode but Suzanne how do we know how do we know
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:09.380]   which plural ending to use? When to use "S" and when to use "Is" how do we know this?
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.420]   Well there are a few rules but first let's listen to some examples and see if we
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.860]   can figure out the rules from those examples. Very good idea. Okay let's do
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:32.060]   that let's listen to an example right now. Dude the bees this year are really
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:39.540]   aggressive. Yeah my friend is a beekeeper and he says that every day he loses his
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.700]   cool because dozens of bees try to escape the hives. Wow what an interesting job I
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.820]   guess he likes bee bites. Nah he works well with them and finds he doesn't get
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.820]   bitten very often. F ever. Well I couldn't do it. A job like that creeps me out takes
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.420]   a lot of courage to stick your hands in a hive full of bees. For sure he takes
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.540]   good care of them and watches each moment when he's dealing with them. I like to
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.780]   watch him in action sometime. Yeah sounds good I'll ask him when he works and we'll
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:29.260]   make a plan. Alright so we just listened to an example so I have to say you made a
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:36.660]   little bit of a weird example but it's good because it really illustrates this
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:44.980]   pronunciation feature of the plural and the third-person S sound. Now Sue like
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.980]   you told us earlier there are three different ways we can pronounce the
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:07:00.660]   plural S third-person S. The first way is just by adding the S sound right yes so
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.100]   why don't we go through the example and find all the times we heard that in the
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.740]   example. Sounds good. What did you hear Sue? Maybe you can point them out to us.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:24.620]   Sure wow what an interesting job I guess he likes bee bites right likes and be
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.820]   bites. I guess he likes be bites yeah so there we heard it two times right likes
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:41.660]   and bites. Next we see nah he works works well with them and finds he doesn't get
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:51.140]   bitten very often if ever. So works works is an S sound. Okay he works with them
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:08:00.880]   perfect works and then in the next line we hear a job like that creeps me out
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:08.340]   creeps creeps okay we got the S there what else and then at the end in the last
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:15.620]   line they say yeah sounds good I'll ask him when he works and we'll make a plan
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:27.700]   works okay very good so in the whole example we heard likes bites works and
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:38.420]   creeps very cool so why do we add a S sound to these words what is the rule
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:45.500]   Suzanne if you notice all of the root words or the words before adding the S
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:53.700]   and in a voiceless consonant a consonant that doesn't have any voice that just
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:08.660]   has air like work or creep or bite or like. These sounds cut and all do not have
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:16.740]   voice so whenever you have a word that ends with a voiceless consonant you're
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:24.580]   going to add an S sound to make it plural or for the third person singular verb
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:34.780]   like works creeps likes and bites very cool so whenever you have a voiceless
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:42.180]   consonant then you just add an S sound to make it plural right so like park would
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:51.180]   become parks shoot would become shoots map would become maps all of those words
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:58.700]   and with voiceless consonants and so we just add S sound to make it plural yeah
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:07.700]   another example is an F sound F is also voiceless so like chef chefs that would
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:13.760]   also have an S at the end perfect perfect so that's our first rule everyone if
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.420]   you have a word that ends in a voiceless consonant that you have to turn into a
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:26.540]   plural or if it's a third person verb then you simply add a S sound to the end
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:32.660]   okay so what about the second rule what is our second pronunciation rule for
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.820]   today so let's look at all of the words that are plural or third person singular
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:45.460]   that end with a Z sound can you help me pick those out Andrew mm-hmm the bees
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:56.780]   dude the bees this year yeah the bees exactly okay we have bees what else did
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:10.660]   I hear I heard says says yep says hives hives yep hives I think we have hands
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:21.340]   hands stick your hands finds finds mm-hmm the last one there is sounds sounds
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:30.380]   okay sounds sounds yeah very good so in all of these words we hear the last
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:36.700]   letter the F the alphabet letter S on the end of the word being pronounced as a
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:45.340]   Z Z as we say yeah I know sorry to confuse you guys so so why why do we
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:53.980]   pronounce these with a Z sound yeah so if you notice all of those words have a
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:12:04.500]   root word that ends with a voiced consonant right like find or sound or
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:15.420]   hive dozen dozens right dozen so these are all words that have voiced
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:23.120]   consonants at the end of their root word and so because of that you will add a
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:31.260]   Z sound at the end when it's plural so it's also important to notice that a
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:40.940]   word that ends with a vowel like be be will go to bees or zoo will go to zoos
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:49.580]   or family will go to families so if it's a voice consonant or a vowel the word
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:57.340]   will have a Z at the end when plural or in the third person singular so just to
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:04.820]   recap our first rule is that if the root word ends with a voiceless consonant
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:10.180]   voiceless sound and that means there's no vibration in your throat when you
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:19.020]   pronounce it then we simply pronounce the S like a S but if the root word ends in
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:25.500]   a voiced consonant this means there's vibration in our throat and this also
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:32.340]   includes words that end with vowels because vowels are voiced then we switch
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:40.860]   to a Z sound when we pronounce the third person singular verb or plural word
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:48.780]   right right very very cool okay so there is one final way that we can
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:55.880]   pronounce the plural S or the third person S on verbs and so what is that
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:01.220]   let's take a look again to go back to the example let's find the instances of
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:06.140]   this third way to pronounce the plural I don't know what did what did you hear I
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:11.340]   think we only have a couple in here yeah it's not as common is it this third
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:20.940]   way yeah it's not as common right so I heard loses loses mmm loses I heard
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:29.140]   watches yes watches and I feel like that's all I heard okay so we we heard
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:36.420]   loses and watches it's actually adding a whole extra syllable to the word isn't
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:44.180]   it lose it becomes lose is watch becomes watches and so what's the rule
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:51.820]   around this when do we add that extra syllable to a word why and when so we
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:15:02.020]   heard lose lose changed to loses loses so the ending of that word was what Andrew
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:14.460]   lose lose so that's a sound yeah so that's a Z and then also watch watch watch
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:23.860]   yeah watch yeah it's a ch sound and in fact it's kind of a form of an S and Z
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:31.620]   right it's kind of in the same family whenever you have an S or a Z at the end
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:47.020]   of a word like loss or lose or a sound like fish or a sound like garage or a
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:58.220]   ch sound like watch or a J sound like judge judge thank you if the word ends
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:09.540]   with a S sound a SH a SH a SH or a J you will add an is at the end of the word to
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:15.420]   make it plural so let's try some examples maybe just because we didn't have so
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:23.340]   many instances in the dialogue cool hey Sue how about I say the singular you say
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:41.540]   the plural sounds great okay lease leases price prizes buzz buzzes mash mashes match
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:49.660]   matches Wow and we can use these as nouns or verbs almost all of those
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:17:00.820]   examples right you could say I sign a lease or I sign leases or I lease a car
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:07.900]   he leases a car right it's the same whether the word is a noun or a verb
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:21.900]   exactly exactly these two cards are matches and well she matches the decor
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:41.420]   of the house perfect or you could say her outfit matches today yeah okay
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:48.900]   everyone so we looked at three different rules for how to pronounce the plural S
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:56.860]   and the third person singular ass in English today thanks to for enlightening
