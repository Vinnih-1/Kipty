[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.780]   The Tragedy at Harper's Ferry, the Liberator, October 28, 1859, by William Lloyd Garrison,
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.660]   recorded for LibriVox.org by M. L. Cohen Cleveland, Ohio March 2007.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.780]   We have devoted a large portion of our present number to the publication of such particulars
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.060]   of the well-intentioned but sadly misguided effort of Captain John Brown and his score
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.140]   of Confederates at Harper's Ferry to liberate the slaves in Virginia and ultimately throughout
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.740]   the South, as have been received.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.100]   With the comments of various Democratic and Republican journals upon this outbreak, which
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.420]   are characterized by an equal mixture of ferocity and cowardice, as to the plot itself, it is
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.580]   evident that few or none were privy to it, except the little band directly engaged in
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.980]   it.
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.180]   For though Captain Brown had many to sympathize with him in different parts of the country,
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.540]   in view of his terrible bereavement, perils, and sufferings in Kansas, in defense of the
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.380]   freedom of that territory against border-roughing invasion, and were disposed to contribute not
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.100]   only to relieve his necessities, but also to facilitate the escape of slaves through his
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.580]   instrumentality to Canada, still an enterprise so wild and futile as this could not have received
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.100]   any countenance in that direction.
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.140]   As to Captain Brown, all who know him personally are united in the conviction that a more honest,
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.140]   conscientious, truthful, brave, disinterested man, prince, however misguided or unfortunate
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.900]   close prince, does not exist, that he possesses a deeply religious nature powerfully wrought
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.700]   upon by the trials through which he has passed, that he as sincerely believes himself to have
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.980]   been raised up by God to deliver the oppressed in this country, in the way he has chosen,
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.060]   as did Moses in relation to the deliverance of the captive Israelites, that when he says
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.740]   he aims to be guided by the golden rule, it is no cant from his lips but a vital application
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.340]   of it to his own soul.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.580]   "Remembering those that are in bonds as bound with them," that when he affirms that he
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.100]   had no other motive for his conduct at Harper's Ferry except to break the chains of the oppressed,
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.420]   by shedding of the least possible amount of human blood, he speaks, quote, "the truth,
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.900]   the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," end quote.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.580]   And that if he shall be, prince, as he will speedily beyond a per-adventure, close prince,
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.340]   with to death, he will not die ignobly, but as a martyr to his sympathy for a suffering
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.180]   race, and in defense of the sacred and inelible rights of man, and will therefore deserve to
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.780]   be held in grateful and honorable remembrance to the latest posterity by all those who glory
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.620]   in the deeds of a Wallis or a tale, a Washington or a Warren.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.500]   Read his replies to interrogatories propounded to him by Senator Mason and others.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.780]   Was there another man of all the thirty millions of people inhabiting this country who could
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.460]   have answered more wisely, more impressively, more courageously, or with greater moral dignity
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.160]   under such a trying ordeal?
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.380]   How many hearts will be thrilled and inspired by his utterances?
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.380]   Read, too, his replies in court with reference to his counsel, "Where shall a more undaunted
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.140]   spirit be found?"
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.180]   And vain will the sanguinary tyrants of the south, and their northern minions seek to cover
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.860]   him with infamy.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.980]   Courts, judges, can inflict no brand of shame, or a shap of death to shroud him from applause.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.620]   For by the logic of Concord, Lexington, and Bunker Hill, and bride the principles enforced
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.540]   by this nation in its boasted declaration of independence, Captain Brown was a hero, struggling
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.580]   against fearful odds, not for his own advantage, but to redeem others from a horrible bondage,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.940]   to be justified in all that he aimed to achieve, however lacking in sound discretion.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.620]   And by the same logic, in the same principles, every slaveholder has forfeited his right
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.100]   to live, if his destruction be necessary to enable his victims to break the yoke of bondage,
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.740]   and they, and all who are disposed to aid them by force and arms, are fully warranted
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.400]   in carrying rebellion to any extent and securing freedom at whatever cost.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.500]   It will be a terribly losing day for all slaveholders when John Brown and his associates are
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.060]   brought to the gallows.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.860]   It will be sowing seed broadcast for a harvest of retribution.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.140]   Their blood will cry trumpet-tongued from the ground, and that cry will be responded
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.140]   to by tens of thousands in a manner that shall cause the knees of the southern slave mongers
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:58.140]   to smite together as did those of Belshazzar of old, O, that they might avoid all this
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.320]   by a timely repentance.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   End of article
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.700]   This recording is in the public domain.
