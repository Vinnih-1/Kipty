[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.720]   Now for this episode, we're doing something a little bit different, a correction challenge,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.440]   because as I was preparing this episode, I realized that we got a few dates and facts
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.120]   wrong during our conversation, so we decided just to leave them in and see if you can spot
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.360]   the errors as you listen, and then once you're finished the episode, you can check the fact
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.360]   check section that we'll put in the description to see how many you were able to notice.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.080]   And with that being said, it's time to get started.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.360]   Let's welcome Luke and we'll begin, here we go.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.720]   Luke, welcome back to the QLIPs English podcast.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.840]   How many times have you been on?
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.040]   This is a third time, fourth time?
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.680]   I think maybe the third time.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   Third time.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000]   And you're in town, and I thought it would be great to get you on the podcast here, so
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520]   we're doing kind of an impromptu recording session, and we're going to talk all about
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.160]   the Winter Olympics, because the Olympics are coming up soon.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.600]   And there's been a lot of chatter in Canada about the Olympics.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.640]   What is some of that chatter that you've heard recently?
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.000]   Some of the chatter would be about the Canadian men's hockey team.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.480]   Yeah, who's going to be playing?
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   Who makes it?
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   Who doesn't?
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   Right.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480]   The lineup.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   Yep.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.520]   And why is this a big deal for Canadians?
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.720]   Why is there so much chatter around the men's Olympic roster and the lineup and ice hockey
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.160]   in general for this Olympic Games?
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.440]   I think they haven't played in the Olympics for a number of years, the professional players.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:44.600]   And so now we did kind of have like an unofficial competition earlier last year, and the Canadians
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.000]   beat the Americans in the final round.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.960]   And now, yeah, it's going to be a much bigger stage, I think.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.080]   Yeah, so there was this tournament last year called the Four Nations Face Off.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.640]   And for whatever reason, the National Hockey League, which is the American or the North
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.840]   American Professional League, hasn't allowed the players to go to the Olympics for the
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.400]   last 10 years or so, maybe longer.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.360]   So a lot of hockey fans, and of course, many Canadians are hockey fans, they have been
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.560]   deprived of best on best hockey because the pro athletes aren't going to the Olympics.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.520]   So that means like when Canada sent an Olympic hockey team in previous years, it was just
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.160]   the amateur athletes, right?
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.760]   All of our best players were playing in the pro leagues.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.480]   They couldn't go to the Olympics.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.040]   And so we were deprived of seeing this best on best hockey.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.680]   And so because of this, the NHL, the North American Professional League, they put together
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.320]   this little tournament last year called the Four Nations Face Off.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.880]   But it was just Canada, USA, Sweden, and Finland, who was the fourth country?
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   I don't even remember.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   Yeah, it could have been Finland.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.760]   I think it was Finland, right?
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.720]   And people were like, where's Russia?
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.160]   Because Russia is a really powerful hockey country as well.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.320]   So there were, yeah, just a lot of people were dissatisfied with this.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.000]   And so the NHL said, OK, players, you can go to the Olympics and now we're having Olympic
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.880]   hockey for the first time in many, many years.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.720]   And so Canadians are stoked.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.920]   And there's been talk for months about which players are going to make the teams.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.960]   So a lot of chatter about this and also some controversy around the ice rink.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   Have you heard about that?
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.600]   Is it that it's slightly shorter?
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.040]   So I don't know how this happened, but they're building the ice rink right now in Italy because
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.600]   this next Olympic Games will be in Italy, right?
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.480]   And for whatever reason, somehow the architecture firm has made the ice rink too short.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.320]   So first of all, people are stressed out because the rink isn't finished yet.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.680]   It's supposed to be finished like two or three days before the puck is supposed to drop for
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.240]   the first game.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.000]   So that's stressful and then secondly, it's too short.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.400]   So yeah, there's a lot of controversy about the Olympics and a lot of chatter about that.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.640]   But maybe we'll talk just more about the Winter Olympics in general.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.440]   What are some of your favorite Winter Olympics sports?
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.840]   One of the most exciting is sports, short track, speed skating.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.040]   Short track, speed skating, yeah.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.200]   And usually Canada, Korea, what are some of the other countries that are up there?
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.440]   China is pretty good.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.440]   China's good.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.400]   America is always strong.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.840]   So usually there's a pretty good- The Dutch, Dutch are good skaters.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.920]   So there's always a lot of fierce competition, a lot of passing and falling behind and things
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   like that.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.000]   So it kind of keeps it exciting and just trying to think of another one.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Curling?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Curling, no.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.200]   I was going to say same with skiing, but I don't know if they have this anymore, but
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:13.440]   they used to have almost like four people going down kind of like a set track on snowboards
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.360]   or skis or something like that.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.800]   They had that with snowboarding for sure.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.520]   It was like an obstacle course almost that they would have to go down.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.840]   Recently, the Olympics have been doing these one-off events, right?
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.320]   The last summer Olympics, they had break dancing and that was just like a one-time showcase.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.280]   I think they had surfing as a one-time showcase in some summer games.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.600]   So I'm not sure if that event was just a one-off showcase or if it's a permanent- I feel like
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.680]   it was just a one-off perhaps.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.360]   I think that one's pretty good and I don't know.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.640]   I like a lot of the skiing or something like that.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.540]   I used to always have to watch it at home because we only had two channels.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.040]   So my mom liked to watch ice skating.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   Right.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.160]   So we know about the triple Lutz and the triple Sow cow.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   Right.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.600]   We know all the names of the figure skating maneuvers because of watching it when we were
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   kids.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.480]   I guess in Canada, the Winter Olympics is a pretty big deal.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.080]   Would you say it's a pretty big deal and people are interested in it and tune in and support
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.680]   the Canadian athletes?
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.920]   How would you say the games are viewed in Canada or regarded in Canada?
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.060]   I don't know the numbers on it but it's definitely more, I would assume, more popular than summer.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.800]   Usually we do the best as far as meddling in gold in the Winter Olympics.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.000]   So most people tune in because that's kind of our strength.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.360]   And I'd love to hear from listeners out there as well to hear how popular the games are in
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.560]   different countries around the world because I have a feeling that the Winter Olympics are
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   not as popular as the Summer Olympics are globally.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.240]   Of course, there are so many countries where it's just never really Winter.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   Right.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.840]   So it doesn't really make sense to have athletes that would participate in the Winter Games
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.400]   or they don't have the facilities to participate.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.960]   So I think there are like a smaller pool of countries who can participate.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.600]   And so maybe some countries in, you know, around the equator or the south or hot places, not
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   so interested.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   Right?
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.520]   Like, I don't know if you were listening in India right now, if you'd be excited for
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.080]   the upcoming Winter Games, but maybe I'm wrong.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.760]   And if you're listening in India and actually it's a big deal, then let me know on our Discord
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   server.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   I'd like to hear about that.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.960]   But yeah, I feel globally, maybe it's not as popular, but it is a big deal in Canada.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.360]   And yeah, I'm wondering, Luke, if you could participate in the Winter Olympics, if you
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:55.100]   could be an athlete in one of the sports, which one would you choose to participate in?
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.080]   Probably go with the one that's the most feasible, which would be curling.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   Curling.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.040]   I mean, it's not going to obviously the most exciting one, but I think if you were a kind
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:13.680]   of just a regular athlete or you trained enough, maybe you could do curling stuff to do it for
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.680]   many years, but I couldn't necessarily be a downhill skier or ski a little bit.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.480]   But I couldn't be that level.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.840]   So you're just thinking more realistically.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.840]   Could I get in?
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.600]   Like, if I practice for 10 years, could I make the team?
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.400]   Yeah, you don't have to be in great, like, physical shape to be a curler.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.360]   I think you need to have a steady hand, you need to be calm under pressure, you have to
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.960]   have great accuracy, but you don't necessarily need to be super strong or super ripped or
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.440]   anything like that.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.760]   I think for me, I'd go for cross-country skiing.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.960]   Again, I'm kind of thinking realistically here.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   I'm not.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   I've never actually tried cross-country skiing, but I think probably it's closest to running.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.200]   So because I enjoy running, I think I'd enjoy cross-country skiing as well.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.840]   A lot of stamina needed.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.920]   Yeah, the endurance.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.240]   I think I could be good with the endurance.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.920]   I tried it once or twice, maybe.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.840]   And yeah, it was a little bit difficult.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.600]   I thought I was in, like, decent shape because that was around the time when I was riding
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.520]   my bike a lot, but yeah, my uncle was still much better than me.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:39.800]   Or I like that sport, the Bayathlon where you have to cross-country ski and then you have
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:45.240]   a rifle on your back and you actually have to shoot a target with a rifle and then cross-country
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.560]   ski and then shoot a target, which is like just this weird sport, like it's crazy that
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.560]   that's a sport.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.800]   It's combining these two weird different skills.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:02.440]   I guess it probably goes way back seems like that's how we would be when we were hunter-gatherers.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.640]   Maybe not on skis, but on some kind of snowshoes or something.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   Very ancient sport.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.080]   Gonna have a steady hand for that one too.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.680]   What are some of the other weird Olympic sports?
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   Well, back in the day, one of those one-off ones was ski dancing, do you remember that?
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:28.640]   Ski dancing was hilarious when we were kids and it was essentially just people on skis
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.880]   who would do a dance routine.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.120]   Yeah, they had poles is like once you've finished the ski run, you're just like on the flat
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.080]   area at the bottom of the ski hill and then you just have your poles and you just do some
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.440]   twirls and spins.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:48.440]   It was kind of like combining rhythmic gymnastics with skis.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.280]   So you're like dancing on skis.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.760]   That was a sport that probably doesn't need to exist.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.640]   Didn't make it to the next year.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.840]   I also think that ski jump is pretty wild.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.400]   Like think about that.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.120]   Why do people need to do the ski jump?
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.880]   It seems so dangerous and...
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.880]   Like the flying one?
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.960]   Where you're at the top of the mountain and you just tuck and go as fast as you can and
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.920]   then just get launched off of massive jump and then fly through the air to see who can
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.000]   go the farthest.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.080]   I mean, it's cool, but it seems super dangerous and like not like we really need to do it.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   I don't know.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.160]   Do you know the landing style?
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.320]   The landing style?
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.080]   They usually have their skis in a V, don't they?
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.560]   I think it's a telemark landing.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.320]   Ah, telemark landing.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.840]   Kind of like one foot's kind of forward and the other one's back.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   Right.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840]   Like kind of, yeah.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.040]   Front legs like a 90 degree angle kind of landing, like a lunge almost.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040]   A lunge.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.320]   Yeah, it looks like you're in a lunge.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.400]   I also wanted to ask you about some skill testing trivia here.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:04.120]   I thought it could be fun if we can try and go back in time and name all the Winter Olympics
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.640]   until we just can't anymore.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.680]   I'm kind of cheating because I didn't look online, I'm going to do this for memory.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.840]   However, I was thinking about this today, so I have a little bit of an advantage.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.400]   I'm going to put you on the spot, but I couldn't even remember the last Winter Olympics where
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   it was.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.720]   I'm going to go back in time and name them, but so we're in 20, I guess the Olympics
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.520]   will be in 2026, right?
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:34.840]   Because they're happening, I believe, like late January, early February of 2026.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.400]   So that would mean four years ago was 2022.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.560]   Where were the 2022 Olympics?
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.560]   Do you remember?
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.400]   I don't know if this is 2022, but was it China?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.040]   I kind of think it was China.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.040]   Beijing.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.680]   Well, you're living in China, so you might know better than I do.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.240]   I know obviously there's a Chinese one recently, but I just couldn't remember the year exactly.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.960]   Yeah, I think it was in China, but it was a little confusing because that was like around
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.960]   the whole COVID thing kind of screwed everything up.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.360]   Like it may have even been delayed or was that the Summer Olympics that was delayed?
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.160]   Maybe Summer.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.880]   There were some COVID related stuff going on.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.840]   So I think that Olympics wasn't even that popular like I felt like I didn't hear about
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.640]   it too much, didn't follow it as much.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:31.280]   Yeah, I think because I live in China was promoted there more so, but yeah, it did have
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:38.320]   that kind of lockdown year stuck in the village type of things, or it wasn't as fun atmosphere,
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320]   maybe.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.080]   But I heard people still liked it.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.480]   And there may not have been as many people who went to go watch, right?
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.640]   Maybe not as many international spectators who went.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.960]   Yeah, if any.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   Right.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:59.000]   So I think, okay, China for 2022, and then four years from that would be 2018.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.680]   2018 was here in South Korea.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   I was here as well.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   Oh, really?
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.880]   I didn't go to the Olympics, but I got a Tuke.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.880]   Okay.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.480]   So 2018 was Pyeongchang here in Kangwon Province.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.760]   And I was here living in Korea as well.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.080]   And in retrospect, I'm kind of kicking myself.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.400]   Why didn't I go up there and check anything out?
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   I know.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.800]   I was not living too far away.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:30.160]   I know people who went and I had some friends who actually got to party with the Canadian
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   athletes.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.000]   Like they saw them just walking through the city and they're like, Hey, nice job.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.360]   Like, what sport do you play?
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.680]   They didn't even know who they were, right?
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.160]   They just started talking with them.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.600]   And they got invited to the athletes village and apparently the athletes village.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.040]   This is a little behind the scenes insider info is pretty wild place.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.520]   After the athletes are finished with their event, they like to party and they like to
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.520]   spend time with the other athletes and it's just a real festive kind of celebration.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.840]   So I heard that was pretty fun.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.940]   And yeah, kicking myself, like I said, for not checking out any of those events or anything.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.480]   Yeah, I know some people because I came with some and they went to the Olympics and then
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   we me and my friend went to Malaysia.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   Okay.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480]   Afterwards.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   Hmm.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   Okay.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.480]   So we both missed out.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   Mm hmm.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.880]   So then 2018 minus four would put us in 2014.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.880]   Where was it?
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   2014.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.880]   2014.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:45.040]   Is it, um, maybe give me the area is it's not Europe, is it, um, kind of spanning Europe
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   and Asia.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   Oh, Russia.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   Sochy.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.040]   Sochy Russia.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:17:00.320]   And then this one you got to get 2010 Vancouver, Vancouver, 2010 also there or at least arrived
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   there.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.120]   So we should have probably went over there because you're in Victoria at the time.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.520]   I was living in Victoria just a stone's throw away from Vancouver.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:16.440]   And I remember this was a huge hockey game for Canada winning the 2010 Olympics.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:22.400]   A lot of Canadians will still remember this fondly winning the gold medal and the men's
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.000]   hockey for the 2010 Olympics.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.760]   It was a big deal because it was at home, right?
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:34.480]   A home victory winning in front of Canadian fans and against the Americans, you know,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.920]   we have a pretty strong rivalry in hockey between Canada and the USA and whenever we
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.160]   can beat the Americans, we love it.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.040]   And whenever we lose, we hate it.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.880]   I was on the airplane when the game happened.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.880]   You were on the airplane.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   I was going back.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   That was 2010.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.800]   So I must have been going back to Korea.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   Okay.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.200]   I was hoping to watch the game or like see the highlights or something later.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:03.800]   But yeah, the pilot was like, oh, we scored ruining the game.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.400]   I was living in an apartment.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   Actually, we, we never lived in that apartment together, but we both lived in that apartment.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.920]   You moved out and your roommate at the time, I think, was looking for a new roommate and
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.160]   I was like, I'll take it.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.520]   And so I moved in.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.920]   So that old apartment where we both lived at different times.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:29.080]   I was in that apartment and I didn't have cable TV or anything, but streaming video
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.520]   technology was like a new thing and it was just being introduced.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.480]   And the CBC website was streaming the hockey game.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.640]   So I set up my computer and I remember I had to download the software to get the live hockey
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.320]   game, but I could watch it online.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.320]   And so that was cool.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.800]   I had some friends over and we were watching the hockey game and the technology was working
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:57.040]   perfectly until like the very end of the game suddenly, like just like 30 seconds before
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.240]   they scored.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   It froze.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.640]   And I was like, oh my God, what's happening?
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.960]   Like, I got to get the game back on.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.920]   And then all of a sudden we hear just from the whole neighborhood, everybody like, yeah.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   And they scored the goal, the winning goal.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:18.520]   And the game was over and I missed the winning goal because of the, the buffering from that
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.160]   early streaming technology.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.960]   So that was, that was too bad, but I have a good memory of like everybody cheering in
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.800]   the streets and being really stoked that we beat the Americans in 2010.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.640]   So then let's go back another four years, 2006.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.640]   2006.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:41.760]   So that be, I was thought it might be Italy, but no, I think it was Italy.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.360]   Wasn't it Turin, Italy, they have them pretty close together.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360]   What's up?
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.240]   What's up with Italy getting two games in 20 years.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.240]   Interesting.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.520]   You know, the IOC, the international Olympic committee, they have a reputation for being
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:04.240]   a little corrupt and you just sort of need to put some money in the right hands and you
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   can get the game.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.880]   Or at least that's the rumors that I hear.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   So I don't know.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.880]   Allegedly.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   Allegedly.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.800]   Maybe there's a little, yeah, Lincoln and Nudge.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.160]   Okay, so 2006, and then let's see if we can keep going back 2002.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.760]   Where were the games in 2002?
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.800]   2002, that's not Utah, is it?
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   Salt Lake City, Utah, very nice.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.920]   I remember these, but I'm not sure if the, like I, I thought Utah might have been a little
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.680]   bit earlier than that.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   Okay.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:50.240]   Salt Lake City, Utah and there's some lore about the Canadian ice hockey victory in that
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   game as well.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.960]   Is that the center ice?
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:21:01.600]   The, the guy, the Zamboni driver or the guy who made the ice for the ice rink for that
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   Olympics.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.320]   He took a Canadian coin, which is called the Looney and he put it in the ice as a good
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.000]   luck symbol and it paid off and we won.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.080]   So that was like his little action that he did for a good luck.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.240]   And yeah, Canada was able to win at that Olympics.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.240]   Okay.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.720]   So 2002, Salt Lake City, what are we going farther back 1998?
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.720]   Do you remember?
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   '98.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.320]   This is when we are like, yeah, it's 13 years old or so.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.760]   I'm, I don't know if this is wrong too, but it was just Japan.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.760]   Yeah, Japan.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.760]   Nagano.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760]   Japan.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.760]   Okay.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   Very good.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.960]   We're getting sketchy here here.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.960]   94.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   94.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   Oh.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   Uh, Lilyhammer.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   Norway.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960]   Lilyhammer.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   Norway.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960]   Well done.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   Okay.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   And then 1992.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   92.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   We were only, how old were we?
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.960]   Great.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.960]   Great too.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.960]   Maybe seven or eight.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   Um.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.960]   I want to say.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:13.560]   I want to say that's like in Eastern Europe or something, but I don't know.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.800]   Maybe that's what I'm thinking Lilyhammer was.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   Um.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.360]   I believe it was in France.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   Albertville?
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360]   No.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   Albertville.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.600]   Is that maybe something, something like Albertville, Tory to our French listeners.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.400]   You guys can fill us a little bit better.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   I don't feel.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.560]   But it was, I believe it was in France.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560]   Could've been.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.560]   Okay.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.520]   That could have also been the summer Olympics.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.680]   Maybe I'm getting it confused with the summer Olympics.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.160]   Don't you like kind of remember some of the announcers talking about Albertville or something
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.200]   like the CBC announcers?
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   I think it's Albertville.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.040]   I think you nailed it.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   Okay.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.600]   Now 1988.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.360]   No, that was Calgary.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.200]   I think Calgary.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.360]   And this was an interesting year in Olympic history because we had the winter Olympics in
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:08.080]   '88 and also the summer Olympics in '88 here in Seoul.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.080]   So I don't know why.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.800]   I guess maybe they, they changed after the Olympics.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.480]   Maybe they're falling on the same year.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   Too many sports guys.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.080]   We need to cut it back.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.840]   I think every two years, not a bad idea.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.240]   Probably end up making more money somehow by doing it that way.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   Staggering them.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.160]   I don't know if we can go back any farther.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   We can go to now see, I don't even know past this like '84.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.360]   We were born in '84, so that's, you know, we're zero years old.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.680]   And that was also must have been summer winter same because '84 was in that LA summer.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   See, I don't even know like when they changed the Olympics year, like I think 1980 might
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.160]   have been like placid, but I don't know where '84 was.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.160]   Let's just check it.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:05.000]   Let's wrap up the game here and we'll turn to Google and I will ask Google, I'm using
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   my voice typing for everything these days, so I'm just going to talk it to my phone.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.760]   List of winter Olympic locations by year.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:22.120]   So while you're bringing that up on the topic of the, whatever that big ski jumping is,
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:29.600]   I think that started in Calgary in '88, I think, with Eddie the Eagle, you know, remember that
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.600]   guy?
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.760]   Yeah, I do.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.720]   Maybe I'm wrong, but Eddie the Eagle was in Calgary.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:51.240]   So yeah, Italy in '26, Beijing 22, Pyeongchang, Sochi, Vancouver, Turin, Salt Lake City, Nagano,
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:25:00.560]   Villa Hammer, Albertville, Calgary, Sarajevo in '84.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.880]   Maybe that's what I was thinking.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.640]   Yugoslavia, Sarajevo.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:13.840]   And then 1980 was Lake Placid and also Moscow, but it doesn't tell me which one was summer.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   Ah, okay.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.240]   Summer was Moscow.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.600]   Winter was Lake Placid.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:25.200]   Yeah, they always had them up until '88, they always happen the same year.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   That's very interesting.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.240]   So you'd have two games every four years, and that's it.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.640]   You have summer and winter in the same year.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.960]   And I highly doubt people would go to the winter and then go to the summer one.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.840]   Yeah, I kind of like that they staggered it.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.840]   I think that's better.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840]   It's more exciting.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   Okay.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.040]   So we'll wrap up this episode here in a second, Luke.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.680]   However, before I do, I want to ask you, what do you think about this?
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.600]   One thing that I've found very interesting about living abroad is how differently the
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:04.200]   Olympics are viewed in Canada and in South Korea, but also watching them on TV is a very
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:11.760]   different experience because I feel like maybe every country is like this, but I only have
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.920]   experience with Korea and Canada, but we only show the sports that we're good at.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:24.000]   So for example, in the summer Olympics, Koreans rack up the medals.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.920]   They kick butt in like archery and shooting and those kinds of sports that require like
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.880]   a steady hand and good accuracy, very, very good at those sports.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.920]   And so they're on the TV all the time.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.240]   And to me, I'm kind of like, I want to watch the soccer.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.600]   I want to watch the volleyball, I want to watch these like more exciting sports because
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.320]   to me, they're not like super, super exciting.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.280]   I still respect those athletes a bunch, but they're not my favorite sports.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:57.000]   However, in Canada, we never see those sports on TV because I think Canadians aren't very
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.120]   good at them, right?
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.520]   So if we have like some runners or some sprinters or the women's Canadian soccer team who are
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.560]   very good, they're on TV all the time, but we don't see those other sports.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:15.600]   And so I think that's a little bit unfortunate for everybody because like for Canadian kids,
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.440]   maybe some kids would be interested in watching archery or shooting or even knowing that they
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.360]   exist as Olympic sports and we don't get to see them.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:29.200]   And then Sam goes here in Korea, like maybe Korean kids would love to watch like the women's
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.840]   soccer games and they don't get played on TV or whatever.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.400]   So I think that's a little bit unfortunate.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.440]   You've been living in China for a while now. Have you ever watched the Olympics in China
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:46.520]   and have you noticed, do they play the sports on TV that Chinese are really good at?
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.920]   I mean, Chinese kind of dominate in all sports, right?
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.200]   They're usually pretty good at a lot of different sports, but have you noticed that at all?
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:01.480]   I think because I don't have cable TV that's it's harder to say, but I'm sure they do probably
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:07.600]   focus on those key sports or the like the premier sports.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.080]   But I've been I think recently, I just kind of go with the streaming just like you did
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.720]   early on and then I can pick and choose the different events.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.800]   So that way you can get a different variety of sports, but yeah, I would say they focus
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:27.080]   on I don't know what's big for them for the winters, probably let's say the short track
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:32.520]   like the skating figure skating things like that. I don't know if they're big in the other
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.240]   ones.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:41.880]   My perspective as an outsider is that China seems to put a pretty high value on winning
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.800]   a lot of Olympic medals and they send a lot of athletes for every kind of sport.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.760]   So yeah, you see like, I think especially in the summer, right gymnastics, diving, those
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:57.840]   kinds of sports they're always very good at. And yeah, I think there's there's always
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.280]   some Chinese athlete that's participating in a lot of sports.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.280]   Mm hmm.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.800]   Yeah, probably the ones that you mentioned though, like figure skating, speed skating,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.920]   they always seem to be pretty competitive in those events.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:16.600]   Mm hmm. Yeah, ours might be well for Canada that is some of the other ones we might be
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:22.160]   good at as like Luge or Bob Slid. Bob Slid's always a fun one. I don't know for that good
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.920]   anymore, but we did have some competitive teams before.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:31.160]   Yeah, yeah, for sure. All right, Luke will wrap things up here. Last question before I
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:37.040]   let you go. Can you make a medal prediction for Canada? How many gold medals are we going
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.760]   to win at this Olympics?
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   Well, you don't really get too many medals for gold, really. So in 2010, I think we won
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.040]   like 10 medals and that was it. And that was the top.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:57.840]   Really? Yeah, it was a quite like 10 to 13 gold medals. And that was like the top world
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   total for gold. So I would assume it would be somewhere around there. I'm going to say
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:15.720]   our rivals probably US might do pretty well this year. And maybe they'll get 15 gold medals.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:21.480]   USA is going to get 15. But what about for Canada? What's your prediction for Canada?
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:30.040]   Well, they'll probably get about nine nine medals nine gold. I'm going to be slightly
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:36.560]   more optimistic than you. And I'm going to say we're going to have an even 10 gold medals.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:43.200]   I won't list the sports. Anyways, guys, that's going to bring us to the end of this conversation.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.120]   Thanks, Luke, for joining me. We'll be tuning into the Olympics. And I always enjoy it.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.360]   Guys, I want to hear from you though. Are the Olympics a big deal in your country? Will
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:59.320]   you be tuning in? What sports does your country do well? And do you agree with my take that
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:04.800]   countries should broadcast all the sports, not just the ones that they're good at? Let
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.960]   me know what you think you can contact me and our entire Q lip community get in touch
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.040]   with us on our discord server. That is the place where Q lips listeners gather. And we
