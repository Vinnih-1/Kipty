[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.400]   The White Chappell Feen has again set that district and all London in a state of terror.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.160]   He murdered not one woman, but two last night and seems bent on beating all previous records
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.720]   in his unheard of crimes.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.080]   His last night's victims were both murdered within an hour, and the second was disemboweled
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.160]   like her predecessors, a portion of her abdomen being missing as in the last case.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.040]   He contented in himself with cutting the throat of the other, doubtless because of interruption.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.800]   Both women were streetwalkers of the lowest class as before.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.640]   These crimes are all of the most daring character.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.840]   The first woman was killed in the open roadway within a few feet of the main street, and
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.940]   though many people were within a few feet distance, no cry was heard.
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520]   This was at midnight.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.880]   Before one o'clock, the second victim was found, and she was so warm that the murder
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.080]   must have taken place but a few minutes before.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.960]   This was in Miter Square, which is but a few blocks distant from the Bank of England and
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.640]   the very heart of the business quarter.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.240]   The square is deserted at night, but is patrolled every half hour, at least, by the police.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.800]   These make six murders to the Feen's credit, all within a half mile radius.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.400]   People are terrified and are allowed in their complaints of the police who have done absolutely
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.800]   nothing.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.720]   They confess themselves without a clue, and they devote their entire energies to preventing
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.280]   the press from getting at the facts.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.000]   They deny to reporters a sight of the scene or bodies and give them no information, whatever.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.760]   The assassin is evidently mocking the police in his barbarous work.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.800]   He waited until the two preceding inquest were quite finished and then murdered two more
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   women.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.120]   He has promised to murder 20 in all and has every prospect of uninterrupted success.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.880]   Also, as London pressed dispatches, London, September 30th.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.480]   This morning the whole city was again startled by the news that two more murders had been
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.400]   added to the list of mysterious crimes that have recently been committed in White Chapel.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.840]   At an early hour, it was known that another victim had been murdered and a report was
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.760]   also current that there was still another victim.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.560]   This report proved true.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.260]   The two victims, as in the former cases, were dissolute women of the poorest class, that
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.160]   the motive of the murderer was not robbery, shown by the fact that no attempt was made
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.560]   to despoil the bodies.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.400]   The first murder occurred in a narrow court off Burner Street at an early hour in the
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.160]   morning between the windows of a foreigner socialist club.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.800]   A concert was in progress and many members of the club were present, but no sound was
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   heard from the victim.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.040]   The same process had been followed as in the other cases.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.600]   The woman had been seized by the throat and her cries choked and the murderer, with one
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.040]   sweeping cut, had severed her throat from ear to ear.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   A clubman, on entering the court, stumbled over the body, which was lying only two yards
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.600]   from the street.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.680]   A stream of warm blood was flowing from the body into the gutter.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.640]   The murderer had evidently been disturbed before he had time to mutilate his victim.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.480]   The second murder was committed from three to four hours later in Miter Square, five
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.520]   minutes walk from the scene of the first crime.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.360]   He's been patrolled to square every ten minutes.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.640]   The body of the unfortunate woman had been disambowed, the throat cut, and the head severed.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.320]   The heart and lungs had been thrown aside, and the entrails were twisted into the gaping
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.160]   wound around the neck.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.720]   The incisions show a rough dexterity.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.840]   The work of the section was evidently done with the utmost haste.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.320]   Pending the report of the doctors, it is not known whether or not a portion of the visceral
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.800]   was taken away.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.680]   The doctors, after a hasty examination of the body, said they thought it must have taken
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.520]   about five minutes to complete the work of the murderer, who then had plenty of time
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.080]   to escape the patrol.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.800]   Miter Square, the scene of the second murder, is a thoroughfare.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.000]   Many people passed through the square early on Sunday morning on their way to prepare
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.120]   for market in the notorious petticoat lane.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.520]   The publicity of the place adds to the daringness of the crime.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.240]   The police, who have been severely criticized in connection with white chapel murders, are
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.240]   paralyzed by these latest crimes.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.080]   As soon as the news was received at police headquarters, a messenger was dispatched for
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.840]   Sir Charles Warren, Chief Commissioner of Police, who was called out of bed and at once visited
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.760]   the scene of the murders.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.520]   The inhabitants of white chapel are dismayed.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.560]   The vigilance committees, which were formed after the first crimes were committed, had
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.240]   relaxed their efforts to capture the murderer.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.680]   At several meetings held in white chapel tonight, it was resolved to resume the work
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.880]   of patrolling the streets in the district in which the murders have occurred.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.360]   The Burner Street victim was Elizabeth Stride, a native of Stockholm, who resided in a common
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.240]   lodging house.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.800]   The name of the other victim is not known, and consequence of the refusal of home secretary
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.480]   Matthews to offer a reward for the arrest of the white chapel murderer or the people
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   of the East End on Saturday petitioned the Queen herself to authorize the offering of
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.160]   a reward.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.960]   Dr. Blackwell, who was called to view the remains of the Burner Street victim, gave it
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.080]   as his opinion that the same man, evidently a maniac, committed both murders.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.760]   The Burner Street victim had evidently been dragged back by a handkerchief worn around
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.080]   the throat.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.480]   The inquest will be held at 11 o'clock Monday morning.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   Four doctors will be on the jury.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.600]   The inquest on the Midasquare victim will probably be held on Tuesday.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.800]   End of article.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.720]   This recording is in the public domain.
